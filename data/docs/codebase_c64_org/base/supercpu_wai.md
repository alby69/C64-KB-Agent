    OP CODE: WAI (WAit for Interrupt)
    =================================
    
    Addressing Modes:
        Implied                            ($cb - 1 byte, 3 cycles¹)
        ¹ Uses 3 cycles to shut the processor down;
        additional cycles are required by interrupt to restart it
    Flags Affected:
        N/A
    Description:
        It has been the goal of the designers of the 65x series to keep
        interrupt latency to a minimum. To further reduce interrupt latency,
        the 65816 introduced a special new instruction, the WAI or wait for
        interrupt instruction.
        In an environment where the processor can be dedicated to serving
        interrupts – that is, where the interrupts provide timing or
        synchronization information, rather than being used to allow
        asynchronous I/O operations to be performed – the processor can be put
        into a special state where it sits and waits for an interrupt to
        happen. This lets any of the user registers be saved before the
        interrupt occurs, and eliminates the latency required to complete an
        existing instruction. Upon execution of a WAI instruction, the
        processor goes into a very low-power state, signals the outside world
        that it is waiting by pulling the bidirectional RDY signal low, and
        sits idle until an interrupt is received. When that occurs, response is
        immediate since no cycles are wasted completing an executing
        instruction.
        There are two responses to an interrupt after the WAI instruction is
        executed. The first, as you might expect, is to release the waiting
        condition and transfer control to the appropriate interrupt vector, as
        normally takes place whenever interrupts are serviced. The second
        response is if maskable interrupts (on the IRQ’ line) have been
        disabled, in which case the normal interrupt processing does not occur.
        However, since the waiting condition is released, execution continues
        with the instruction following the WAI opcode. This means that
        specialized interrupt-synchronization routines can be coded with a
        one-cycle latency between receipt of interrupt and response.
        Pulla the RDY pin low. Power consumption is reduced and RDY remains low
        until an external hardware interrupt (NMI, IRQ, ABORT, or RESET) is
        received.
        WAI is designed to put the processor to sleep during an external event
        to reduce its power consumption, to allow it to be synchronized with an
        external event, and/or to reduce interrupt latency (an interrupt
        occurring during execution of an instruction is not acted upon until
        execution of the instruction is complete, perhaps many cycles later;
        WAI ensures that an interrupt is recognized immediately).
        Once an interrupt is received, control is vectored through one of the
        hardware interrupt vectors; an RTI from the interrupt handling routine
        will return control to the instruction following the original WAI.
        However, if by setting the i flag, interrupt have been disabled prior
        to the execution of the WAI instruction, and IRQ’ is asserted, the
        “wait” condition is terminated and control resumes with the next
        instruction, rather than through the interrupt vectors. This provides
        the quickest response to an interrupt, allowing synchronization with
        external events. WAI also frees up the bus; since RDY is pulled low in
        the third instruction cycle, the processor may be disconnected from the
        bus if BE is also pulled low.
        The WAI instruction pulls RDY low and places the processor in the WAI
        "low power" mode. /NMI, /IRQ or /RESET will terminate the WAI condition
        and transfer control to the interrupt handler routine.
        Note that an /ABORT input will abort the WAI instruction, but will not
        restart the processor.
        When the Status Register I flag is set (IRQ disabled), the IRQ
        interrupt will cause the next instruction (following the WAI
        instruction) to be executed without going to the IRQ interrupt handler.
        This method results in the highest speed response to an IRQ input. When
        an interrupt is received after an ABORT which occurs during the WAI
        instruction, the processor will return to the WAI instruction.
        Other than RES (highest priority), ABORT is the next highest priority,
        followed by NMI or IRQ interrupts.
    Notes:
        If WAI is used after 'CLI' in an IRQ setup, a 'JMP' back to the WAI
        OPC must be done. The Interrupt handler will still trigger. This is
        not excatly as described above, but uncertain if this is an emulator
        issue or doc error.

    OP CODE: WAI (WAit for Interrupt)
    =================================
    
    Addressing Modes:

    Description:
        It has been the goal of the designers of the 65x series to keep
        interrupt latency to a minimum. To further reduce interrupt latency,
        the 65816 introduced a special new instruction, the WAI or wait for
        interrupt instruction.

        In an environment where the processor can be dedicated to serving
        interrupts – that is, where the interrupts provide timing or
        synchronization information, rather than being used to allow
        asynchronous I/O operations to be performed – the processor can be put
        into a special state where it sits and waits for an interrupt to
        happen. This lets any of the user registers be saved before the
        interrupt occurs, and eliminates the latency required to complete an
        existing instruction. Upon execution of a WAI instruction, the
        processor goes into a very low-power state, signals the outside world
        that it is waiting by pulling the bidirectional RDY signal low, and
        sits idle until an interrupt is received. When that occurs, response is
        immediate since no cycles are wasted completing an executing
        instruction.

        There are two responses to an interrupt after the WAI instruction is
        executed. The first, as you might expect, is to release the waiting
        condition and transfer control to the appropriate interrupt vector, as
        normally takes place whenever interrupts are serviced. The second
        response is if maskable interrupts (on the IRQ’ line) have been
        disabled, in which case the normal interrupt processing does not occur.
        However, since the waiting condition is released, execution continues
        with the instruction following the WAI opcode. This means that
        specialized interrupt-synchronization routines can be coded with a
        one-cycle latency between receipt of interrupt and response.

        Pulla the RDY pin low. Power consumption is reduced and RDY remains low
        until an external hardware interrupt (NMI, IRQ, ABORT, or RESET) is
        received.

        WAI is designed to put the processor to sleep during an external event
        to reduce its power consumption, to allow it to be synchronized with an
        external event, and/or to reduce interrupt latency (an interrupt
        occurring during execution of an instruction is not acted upon until
        execution of the instruction is complete, perhaps many cycles later;
        WAI ensures that an interrupt is recognized immediately).

        Once an interrupt is received, control is vectored through one of the
        hardware interrupt vectors; an RTI from the interrupt handling routine
        will return control to the instruction following the original WAI.
        However, if by setting the i flag, interrupt have been disabled prior
        to the execution of the WAI instruction, and IRQ’ is asserted, the
        “wait” condition is terminated and control resumes with the next
        instruction, rather than through the interrupt vectors. This provides
        the quickest response to an interrupt, allowing synchronization with
        external events. WAI also frees up the bus; since RDY is pulled low in
        the third instruction cycle, the processor may be disconnected from the
        bus if BE is also pulled low.

        The WAI instruction pulls RDY low and places the processor in the WAI
        "low power" mode. /NMI, /IRQ or /RESET will terminate the WAI condition
        and transfer control to the interrupt handler routine.

        Note that an /ABORT input will abort the WAI instruction, but will not
        restart the processor.

        When the Status Register I flag is set (IRQ disabled), the IRQ
        interrupt will cause the next instruction (following the WAI
        instruction) to be executed without going to the IRQ interrupt handler.

        This method results in the highest speed response to an IRQ input. When
        an interrupt is received after an ABORT which occurs during the WAI
        instruction, the processor will return to the WAI instruction.
        Other than RES (highest priority), ABORT is the next highest priority,
        followed by NMI or IRQ interrupts.

    Notes:
        If WAI is used after 'CLI' in an IRQ setup, a 'JMP' back to the WAI
        OPC must be done. The Interrupt handler will still trigger. This is
        not excatly as described above, but uncertain if this is an emulator
        issue or doc error.
