# base:rr_flashing [Codebase64 wiki]

This article deals with a very sophisticated issue: programming the FlashROM. You will need thorough understanding of how the chip works. All of the code provided is commented well, but you still have to know what you are doing. You won't physically destroy your ROM chip or the cart, though.

The code originates from my FMEEPROMPP utility. The ordinal numbers and byte codes refer to the FlashROM command sequence steps. PA and PD stand for the address and data to be programmed. All of this is explained in the FlashROM data sheet.

Regarding flashing the chip, read especially the programming algorithm section and also see the waveform tables for timing information. This code appears to work, but especially the programming routine gets so complicated, there may be errors, so take care!

You can find the print routine in [string manipulation routines](https://codebase.c64.org/doku.php?id=base:string_manipulation_routines).
