## With RMW instructions

```
        ; beginning of combined raster/timer interrupt routine
        LSR $D019       ; clear VIC interrupts, read raster interrupt flag to C
        BCS raster      ; jump if VIC caused an interrupt
        ...             ; timer interrupt routine
        Operational diagram of LSR $D019:
          #  data  address  R/W
         --- ----  -------  ---  ---------------------------------
          1   4E     PC      R   fetch opcode
          2   19    PC+1     R   fetch address low
          3   D0    PC+2     R   fetch address high
          4   xx    $D019    R   read memory
          5   xx    $D019    W   write the value back, rotate right
          6  xx/2   $D019    W   write the new value back
        The 5th cycle acknowledges the interrupt by writing the same
        value back. If only raster interrupts are used, the 6th cycle
        has no effect on the VIC. (It might acknowledge also some
        other interrupts.)

        ($0318), which points to the following routine:

                BNE LOOP        ; #$FF to #$0F changes the image.
        When an NMI occurs, the processor jumps to Kernal code, which
        jumps to ($0318), which points to the following routine:
        DD0C    RTI
        How on earth can this clear the interrupts? Remember, the
        processor always fetches two successive bytes for each
        instruction.
        A little more practical version of this is redirecting the NMI
        (or IRQ) to your own routine, whose last instruction is JMP
        $DD0C or JMP $DC0C.  If you want to confuse more, change the 0
        in the address to a hexadecimal digit different from the one
        you used when writing the RTI.
        Or you can combine the latter two methods:
        DD09    LSR $xx  ; xx is any appropriate BCD value 00-59.
                BPL $DCFC
        DCFC    RTI
        This example acknowledges interrupts to both CIAs.
```
If you want to confuse the examiners of your code, you can use any of these techniques. Although these examples use no undefined opcodes, they do not necessarily run correctly on CMOS processors. However, the RTI example should run on 65C02 and 65C816, and the latter branch instruction example might work as well.

The RMW instruction method has been used in some demos, others were developed by Marko Mäkelä. His favourite is the automagical RTI method, although it does not have any practical applications, except for some time dependent data decryption routines for very complicated copy protections.

        BCS raster      ; jump if VIC caused an interrupt
        ...             ; timer interrupt routine

        Operational diagram of LSR $D019:

          1   4E     PC      R   fetch opcode

          6  xx/2   $D019    W   write the new value back

        The 5th cycle acknowledges the interrupt by writing the same
        value back. If only raster interrupts are used, the 6th cycle
        has no effect on the VIC. (It might acknowledge also some
        other interrupts.)

                STA $DD0D       ; disable CIA 2's all interrupt sources
                LDA $DD0E
                AND #$BE        ; ensure that $DD0C remains constant
                STA $DD0E       ; and stop the timer
                LDA #$40
                STA $DD0C       ; store RTI to $DD0C
                LDA #$0C
                STA $FFFA
                LDA #$DD
                STA $FFFB       ; change NMI vector to $DD0C
                LDA #$FF        ; Try changing this instruction's operand
                STA $DD05       ; (see comment below).
                LDA #$FF
                STA $DD04       ; set interrupt frequency to 1/65536 cycles
                LDA $DD0E
                AND #$80
                ORA #$11
                LDX #$81
                STX $DD0D       ; enable timer interrupt
                STA $DD0E       ; start timer

                LDA #$00        ; To see that the interrupts really occur,
                STA $D011       ; use something like this and see how
        LOOP    DEC $D020       ; changing the byte loaded to $DD05 from
                BNE LOOP        ; #$FF to #$0F changes the image.

        When an NMI occurs, the processor jumps to Kernal code, which
        jumps to ($0318), which points to the following routine:

        DD0C    RTI

        How on earth can this clear the interrupts? Remember, the
        processor always fetches two successive bytes for each
        instruction.

        A little more practical version of this is redirecting the NMI
        (or IRQ) to your own routine, whose last instruction is JMP
        $DD0C or JMP $DC0C.  If you want to confuse more, change the 0
        in the address to a hexadecimal digit different from the one
        you used when writing the RTI.

        Or you can combine the latter two methods:

        DD09    LSR $xx  ; xx is any appropriate BCD value 00-59.
                BPL $DCFC
        DCFC    RTI

        This example acknowledges interrupts to both CIAs.
