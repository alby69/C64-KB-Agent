    OP CODE: PLB (PulL data Bank register)
    ======================================
    
    Addressing Modes:
        Stack                            ($ab - 1 byte, 4 cycles)
    Flags Affected:
        n - Set if most significant bit of pulled value is set; else cleared.
        z - Set if value pulled is zero; else cleared.
    Description:
        Pull the eight-bit value on top of the stack into the data bank
        register B, switching the data bank to that value. All instructions
        which reference data that specify only sixteen-bit addresses will get
        their bank address from the value pulled into the data bank register.
        This is the only instruction that can modify the data bank register.
        Since the bank register is an eight-bit register, only one byte is
        pulled from the stack, regardless of the settings of the m and x mode
        select flags. The stack pointer is first incremented. Then the byte
        pointed to by the stack pointer is loaded into the register.
    Notes:
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
    .pseudocommand plb {
        .byte $ab
