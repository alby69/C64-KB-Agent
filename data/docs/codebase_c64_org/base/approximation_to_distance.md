# Approximation to distance

base:approximation_to_distance

                # Approximation to distance

Classic distance formula is d= SQR( (x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2)) and it is well known that if you are comparing the magnitude of two distances you can avoid doing the square root operation as the square of the distances sort in the same order. However, to avoid the square root and the multiplication is the intent of this approximation.

The following approximation is based on a combination of linear components of the min and max functions.

The formula is d = max(|xd|, |yd|) + 1/2 × min(|xd|, |yd|) where xd = (x1-x2) and yd = (y1-y2)

Note that for 6502 we will use a shift right to calculate the multiply by 1/2.
