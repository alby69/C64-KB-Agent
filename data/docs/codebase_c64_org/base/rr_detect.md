# Detect Retro Replay hardware

base:rr_detect

                # Detect Retro Replay hardware

By FMan.

This is a straight-forward detection routine to find out if a Retro Replay is active on the system. It works by writing different bytes to the same address in the $8000-$9FFF range. If there is no cart, all of the writes will go to normal RAM and the latest byte will be the one read back. Otherwise some of them go to different RR RAM banks. Successful readback of both bytes written to the RR RAM will be taken to signal the presence of a Retro Replay.

Find the print routine [elsewhere](https://codebase.c64.org/doku.php?id=base:string_manipulation_routines). This routine is well tested and is believed to reliably identify either the presence or nonexistence of an RR.
