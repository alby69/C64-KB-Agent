# Launching long tasks from inside a IRQ handler

# Launching long tasks from inside a IRQ handler

by Bitbreaker/Oxyron/*

When executing code within an IRQ handler you have to finish things before the next IRQ occurs. But sometimes tasks just take some more time, for that you can spin off those tasks from inside the handler, and allow then upcoming IRQs to happen.

Basically there is two scenarios that we can handle in an easy and an more sophisticated way. The first scenario is, if you have a long task that takes several frames, and that is only spin off seldom. Imagine you shift a bitmap 8 pixels wide and move the whole bitmap each 8 frames. Lets say the moving takes 7 frames. This can all be done from IRQ.

When the IRQ handler finishes it would fetch 3 bytes from stack and return to the code that was interrupted by the IRQ. Here is the point where we start with this scenario. We simply squeeze in our new task by adding another 3 bytes to the stack. Thus before continuing with the interrupted code our new task will be executed first. Also, this way further code after the spin off can be done by the interrupt-handler. If this is not wanted, we could also do a mixture of both scenarios. Then the copy over of the registers is enough and we can just start our task after we clear the interrupt flag with a jmp.

```
irq
       ;save registers
       sta reg_a
       stx reg_x
       sty reg_y
       ;... your desired irq handler code goes here
       lda some_condition
       beq skip_long
       
       ;now push 3 more bytes on stack
       lda #>task
       pha
       lda #<task
       pha
       ;flags, can even be used to signal stuff to task by setting carry/overflow/negative/...
       lda #$00
       pha
       
skip_long
       ;here, further code can happen that has nothing to do with our task
       ;restore registers
       lda reg_a
       ldx reg_x
       ldy reg_y
       ;rti will now finish this interrupt and continue with the new task instead of the code
       ;being executed before this IRQ occurred.
       rti
    
task
       ;store registers again
       sta reg_a_
       stx reg_x_
       sty reg_y_
       ;...some long long code
    
       ;restore registers
       lda reg_a_
       ldx reg_x_
       ldy reg_y_
       ;now finally continue with code being executed before IRQ that spun of our task
       rti
```
The second scenario spins off a task in every frame, with the task being finished until the next IRQ occurs. In this case it is sufficient to just clear the IRQ flag and let the next IRQ happen. But this only works if the next IRQ is a different IRQ with different handler, else we would have a clash in the saved registers, and values piling up on stack. Imagine you have one interrupt happening at rasterline $32 and it will usually take until line $120 or shorter. Now you want to have your music play at line $ff constantly to have no sound glitches. To solve that conflict you can do:

```
irq1
        dec $d019
        ;save your registers
        sta reg_a
        stx reg_x
        sty reg_y
        
        ;set up next irq to play music
        lda #<irq2
        sta $fffe
        lda #>irq2
        sta $ffff
        
        lda #$ff
        sta $d012
        
        ;now allow irq2 to happen on top of this task and return to this task when done
        cli
        
        ... effect that takes much cycles ...
        
        ;restore registers
        ldy reg_y
        ldx reg_x
        lda reg_a
        rti
        
irq2
        dec $d019
        ;use different locations to store registers (we might still need those that we saved in the previous IRQ)
        sta reg_a_
        stx reg_x_
        sty reg_y_
        
        jsr $1003
        
        ;setup next irq1
        lda #$32
        sta $d012
        
        lda #<irq1
        sta $fffe
        lda #>irq1
        sta $ffff
        ldy reg_y_
        ldx reg_x_
        lda reg_a_
        rti
```
A even more convenient variant is to use the stack for register saving:

```
irq1
        pha
        txa
        pha
        tya
        pha
        dec $d019
        
        dec counter
        bne +
        
        lda #$08
        sta counter
        cli
        jsr long_task
+
        pla
        tay
        pla
        tax
        pla
        rti
```
Now you can run a long task that can finish somewhen between the next 8 interrupts.
