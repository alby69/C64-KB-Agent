# 16-Bit Comparison

One would think that a compare and branch approach would suffice when comparing 16 bit numbers, but this is not the case if you want full compatibility (If you don't care about the NEGATIVE Flag, it is a lot easier). If we consider two U16 numbers (A and M), there are many fringe cases which messes up due to the special handling of the NEGATIVE flag which strictly is set according to BIT15 of the A - M subtraction result.

For example:

```
    A = #$8000 & M = #$0001 => Subtraction result = #$7fff
    A  > M          => CARRY    = SET
    A != M          => ZERO     = CLEAR
    A  - M < #$8000 => NEGATIVE = CLEAR
```
Branching your way out of that one isn't straight forwards. If you compare the Hi-bytes, the result is negative (#$80 - #00 = #$80). If you Compare the lo-bytes the result is also negative (#$00 - #$01 = #$ff) so one would have to carry out the subtraction and rely on the hibyte result (#$7f) while ensuring that CARRY and ZERO remins correct.

## TWW Method

16 bit equivalent of the CMP OPC:

```
/*! «»«»«»«»{CMP16}«»«»«»«»
    Does exactly the same as CMP of two values (effectively its a A - M) and sets the flags as follows:
                 (BCC/BCS)     (BEQ/BNE)         (BMI/BPL)
    If A = M : Carry =  SET   Zero =  SET   Negative = BIT15 of subtraction result
    If A > M : Carry =  SET   Zero = CLEAR  Negative = BIT15 of subtraction result
    If A < M : Carry = CLEAR  Zero = CLEAR  Negative = BIT15 of subtraction result
*/
    // sta SMC_ACC        // preserva A
    lda A
    cmp M
    php
    lda A + 1
    sbc M + 1
    php
    pla
    sta SMC
    pla
    ora #%11111101
    and SMC: #$00
    pha
    // lda SMC_ACC: #$00  // Restore ACC
    plp
```
You may optionally preserve ACC if you wish a “fully featured” CMP16. The above has been tested for all combinations and results and passes in the following setup.

```
    mov16 #$0000 : ZP.A
    mov16 #$0000 : ZP.M
!TestNext:
    cmp16 ZP.A : ZP.M
    jsr SUB_TestResult      // Tests the flag results and halts with apropriate error code
    inc16 ZP.A
    bne !TestNext-
    inc16 ZP.M
    bne !TestNext-
```
Yes it takes a while…

## Branching Approach ignoring NEGATIVE

Different approach: instead of setting flags, goes to different destinations:

; Val1 ≥ Val2 ? LDA Val1 +1 ; high bytes CMP Val2+1 BCC LsThan ; hiVal1 < hiVal2 --> Val1 < Val2 BNE GrtEqu ; hiVal1 ≠ hiVal2 --> Val1 > Val2 LDA Val1 ; low bytes CMP Val2 ;BEQ Equal ; Val1 = Val2 BCS GrtEqu ; loVal1 ≥ loVal2 --> Val1 ≥ Val2 LsThan ... GrtEqu ...

Note! The above fails in handling the N flag. If for exampel A = #$0080 and M = #$0000, the BCS GrtEqu will branch since #$80 > #$00, but it will also set the N Flag which should not be set as #$0080 - #$0000 = #$0080 (Positive).

## Codice Estratto

### Snippet Codice (Dialetto: Generic Assembly)

```assembly
A = #$8000 & M = #$0001 => Subtraction result = #$7fff

    A  > M          => CARRY    = SET
    A != M          => ZERO     = CLEAR
    A  - M < #$8000 => NEGATIVE = CLEAR
```

### Snippet Codice (BASIC)

```basic
/*! «»«»«»«»{CMP16}«»«»«»«»
    Does exactly the same as CMP of two values (effectively its a A - M) and sets the flags as follows:

                 (BCC/BCS)     (BEQ/BNE)         (BMI/BPL)
    If A = M : Carry =  SET   Zero =  SET   Negative = BIT15 of subtraction result
    If A > M : Carry =  SET   Zero = CLEAR  Negative = BIT15 of subtraction result
    If A < M : Carry = CLEAR  Zero = CLEAR  Negative = BIT15 of subtraction result
*/
    // sta SMC_ACC        // preserva A
    lda A
    cmp M
    php
