    OP CODE: PHK (PusH program bank register)
    =========================================
    
    Addressing Modes:
        Stack (Push)                     ($4b - 1 byte, 3 cycles)
    Flags Affected:
        N/A
    Description:
        Push the program bank register onto the stack.
        The single-byte contents of the program bank register are pushed. The
        program bank register itself is unchanged. The stack pointer now points
        to the next available stack location, directly below the byte pushed.
        Since the program bank register is an eight-bit register, only one byte
        is pushed onto the stack, regardless of the settings of the m and x
        mode select flags.
        While the 65816 always generates 24-bit addresses, most jumps and
        branches specify only a sixteen-bit address. These addresses are
        concatenated with the contents of the program bank register to form a
        full 24-bit address. This instruction lets you determine the current
        value of the program bank register – for example, if you want the data
        bank to be set to the same value as the program bank.
