    /*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
    OP CODE: REP (REset Status (P) Bits)
    ====================================
    
    Addressing Modes:
        Immediate                        ($c2 - 2 bytes, 3 cycles)
    Flags Affected:
        65802/65816 emulation mode e=1:
            n - Set/Reset
            v - Set/Reset
            d - Set/Reset
            i - Set/Reset
            z - Set/Reset
            c - Set/Reset
        65802/65816 native mode e=0:
            n - Set/Reset
            v - Set/Reset
            m - Set/Reset
            x - Set/Reset
            d - Set/Reset
            i - Set/Reset
            z - Set/Reset
            c - Set/Reset
            All flags for which an operand bit is set are reset to zero.
            All other flags are unaffected by the instruction.
    Description:
        For each bit set to one in the operand byte, reset the corresponding
        bit in the status register to zero. For example, if bit three is set in
        the operand byte, bit three in the status register (the decimal flag)
        is reset to zero by this instruction. Zeroes in the operand byte cause
        no change to their corresponding status register bits.
        This instruction lets you reset any flag or flags in the status register
        with a single two-byte instruction. Further, it is the only direct means
        of resetting several of the flags, including the m and x mode select
        flags (although instructions that pull the P status register affect the
        m and x mode select flags).
        6502 emulation mode (65802/65816, e=1): Neither the break flag nor bit
        five (the 6502’s undefined flag bit) are affected by REP.
    Notes:
