    OP CODE: PEA (Push Effective Absolute address)
    ==============================================
    
    Addressing Modes:
        Stac (Absolute)                  ($f4 - 3 bytes, 5 cycles)
    Flags Affected:
        N/A
    Description:
        Push the sixteen-bit operand (typically an absolute address) onto the
        stack. The stack pointer is decremented twice. This operation always
        pushes sixteen bits of data, irrespective of the settings of the m and
        x mode select flags.
        Although the mnemonic suggests that the sixteen-bit value pushed on the
        stack be considered an address, the instruction may also be considered
        a “push sixteen-bit immediate data” instruction, although the syntax of
        immediate addressing is not used. The assembler syntax is that of the
        absolute addressing mode, that is, a label or sixteen-bit value in the
        operand field. Unlike all other instructions that use this assembler
        syntax, the effective address itself, rather than the data stored at
        the effective address, is what is accessed (and in this case, pushed
        onto the stack).
    Notes:
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
