# XCE

                # XCE

    /*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
    OP CODE: XCE (Exchange Carry and Emulation bits)
    ================================================
    
    Addressing Modes:
        Implied                            ($fb - 1 byte, 2 cycles)
    Flags Affected:
        e - Takes carry’s previous value: set if carry was set; else cleared.
        c - Takes emulation’s previous value: set if previous mode was
            emulation; else cleared.
        m - m is a Native Mode (NM) flag only; switching to NM sets it to 1.
        x - x is a native mode flag only; it becomes the b flag in emulation.
        b - b is an emulation mode flag only; it is set to 1 to become the x
            flag in native.
    Description:
        This instruction is the only means provided by the 65802 and 65816 to
        shift between 6502 emulation mode and the full, sixteen-bit native
        mode.
        The emulation mode is used to provide hardware and software
        compatibility between the 6502 and 65802/65816.
        If the processor is in emulation mode, then to switch to native mode,
        first clear the carry bit, then execute an XCE. Since it is an exchange
        operation, the carry flag will reflect the previous state of the
        emulation bit. Switching to native mode causes bit five to stop
        functioning as the break flag, and function instead as the x mode
        select flag. A second mode select flag, m, uses bit six, which was
        unused in emulation mode. Both mode select flags are initially set to
        one (eight-bit modes). There are also other differences described in
        the text.
        If the processor is in native mode, then to switch to emulation mode,
        you first set the carry bit, then execute an XCE. Switching to
        emulation mode causes the mode select flags (m and x) to be lost from
        the status register, with x replaced by the b break flag. This forces
        the accumulator to eight bits, but the high accumulator byte is
        preserved in the hidden B accumulator. It also forces the index
        registers to eight bits, causing the loss of values in their high
        bytes, and the stack to page one, causing the loss of the high byte of
        the previous stack address. There are also other differences described
        in the text.
