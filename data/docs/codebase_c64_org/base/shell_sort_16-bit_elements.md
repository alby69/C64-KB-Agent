# Shell Sort (for 16-bit Elements)

# Shell Sort (for 16-bit Elements)

by Fredrik Ramsberg, 29 Dec 2004

Here's my implementation of Shell Sort, a sort algorithm with rather amazing properties. All mathematicians that have tried to analyze this algorithm have failed, but there's lots of empirical data that suggests it's roughly O(n log n). I wish I could say I invented this algorithm, but I didn't. This is an equivalent Javascript routine that mimics the Shell Shot presented here:

```
function ShellSort(arr,length) {
  var j, i, v, h, k;
  for (h=1; h < length; h=3*h+1);
  while (h=(h-1)/3)
    for (i=h, j=i, v=arr[i]; i<=length; arr[j+h]=v, i++, j=i, v=arr[i])
      while((j-=h) >= 0 && arr[j] > v)
        arr[j+h]=arr[j];
}
```
This is source code for what is meant to be an efficient implementation of Shell Sort in 6502 assembler. This implementation can sort more than 32,000 16-bit values. The only reason it can't sort 32,767 values is that there still has to be room for the routine and a few bytes for temporary storage. There's presently no other sorting routine in the repository that can handle more than 256 values. The source code is in a format suitable for the excellent and free ACME cross-assembler by Marco Baye, but should be easy to convert for other assemblers.

While Shell Sort is very good for entirely unsorted arrays, it is also reasonably good for almost sorted arrays. However, if you happen to know that very few values are out of place OR that the values that are out of place are not very far from their right position, Insertion Sort is a better choice. Insertion Sort is also provided here, since Shell Sort is really just a clever extension of Insertion Sort.

Here are some examples of sort times @ 1MHz (10,000 values):

| Operation | Insertion Sort | Shell Sort | 
|---|---|---|
| Array is entirely sorted from the start | 1.9s | 14.7s | 
| 1 value is at the wrong end of the array | 2.9s | 15.7s | 
| 10 values are at the wrong end of the array | 11.8s | 16.9s | 
| 50 values are at the wrong end of the array | 51.3s | 17.6s | 
| Array is entirely unsorted | 2464.2s | 30.5s | 

To call the routine, create a word-array at address nnnn in memory. The first word should contain the number of bytes to be sorted (= 2 * the number of elements), then come all those elements. Next, sort the elements using Shell Short like this:

lda #<nnnn ldx #>nnnn jsr shell_sort

or to perform an Insertion Sort:

lda #<nnnn ldx #>nnnn jsr insertion_sort

In the code snippits above, < means the low-byte and > means the high-byte. Some assemblers use x & $FF for the low-byte and nnnn » 8 for the high-byte.

; This describes the sequence h(0)=1; h(n)=k*h(n-1)+1 for k=3 (1,4,13,40...)
; All word-values are muliplied by 2, since we are sorting 2-byte values
h_low           !byte <2, <8, <26, <80, <242, <728, <2186, <6560, <19682
h_high          !byte >2, >8, >26, >80, >242, >728, >2186, >6560, >19682
h_start_index   !byte 0
h_index         !byte 0
h               !word 0
in_address      !word 0
arr_start       !word 0
arr_end         !word 0
i               !word 0
v               !word 0
v_plus_1        !word 0
```
To increase speed and reduce code size, you can optionally place one or more of these 2-byte fields on zero-page (the suggested values work on a Commodore 64):

v_plus_1 = $5 h = $7 arr_start = $A

Some simple tests using an array of 10,000 completely unsorted values showed a 5.6% shorter execution time if all three fields were placed on ZP, with v_plus_1 being a little more important than the others.

To go even further, placing these 2-byte fields on zero-page will provide a small improvement:

v i arr_end

(This paragraph is added by litwr.)  It is possible to speed up this sort by 15-25%.  This requires only to change *h_high* and *h_low* tables.  For example,

h_low .byte <2, <8, <20, <46, <114, <264, <602, <1402, <3500, <9518, <25846 h_high .byte >2, >8, >20, >46, >114, >264, >602, >1402, >3500, >9518, >25846

will make the trick.
