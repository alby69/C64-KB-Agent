# Helikopter Jagd Trainer Tutorial

# Helikopter Jagd Trainer Tutorial

Using a version cracked by Flash Cracking Group (FCG).
[http://csdb.dk/release/?id=40760](http://csdb.dk/release/?id=40760)

Trainer tutorial by CSixx/uS

Step 1:

We will use a method suggested by iAN CooG on Lemon forums. Starting with the FCG version of the game from CSDB, launch the d64 in WinVice. Start the gameplay, and before you lose a life, enter the monitor (alt-m). Save the ram using the following commands: (do not type the > sign)

bank ram s "lives4" 0 2 ffff

Resume gameplay and lose a life. Re-enter the monitor and save the ram:

bank ram s "lives3" 0 2 ffff

Do this once more, lose a life then save the ram:

bank ram s "lives2" 0 2 ffff

Now we can generate some diff files, from a DOS command prompt type:

fc lives4 lives3 /b>diff1.txt

Then again for the second compare:

fc lives3 lives2 /b>diff2.txt

Now we have two files that show the changes to the c64 memory when lives are lost.

At this point, to make it easier to parse, I wrote my own tool to compare the two files and only single out entries that increased or decreased incrementally. You can do this manually of course or you can download the tool here:

Once you have the tool, press the load button on the left hand side and select the diff1.txt file we created. Then do the same in the right window and select diff2.txt.

Once finished, press the search button.

The bottom window will contain all the memory locations that changed by 1. We can look through the list and some possible addresses that match the number of lives we had and now have…

In this case, the following one looks interesting:

000027e1: 03 02 01

Restart the game and we will put a watch point on that address in WinVice. Once the gameplay has started, enter the monitor and type the following:

watch store 27e1

This tells winvice to open the monitor when any code stores a value to 27e1. Close the monitor to resume the game and lose a life. The monitor will automatically open now and above the prompt you will see the address directly following a write to 27e1.

It will look like this:

** Monitor 079 053 (C:$1ff6) #1 (Watch-store) .C:1ff6 30 09 BMI $2001

Now, from the view menu, open the disassembly window. It should be highlighted blue on line 1FF6. Scroll up and lets look at the line just before it.

1FF3: CE E1 27 DEC $27E1

We can see that this is DECrementing the address we are watching. To give unlimited lives, all we need to do now is to change the three opcodes that make up this DECrement instruction (CE E1 27) to the opcode for No-OPeration, meaning do nothing (EA).

Some assembly code to do this is:

lda #$ea sta $1ff3 sta $1ff4 sta $1ff5

Now that we know what we need to do, and we have the code to do it, we need to get our changes into the program file. In order to do that we have to unpack the original file.

The original cracker (Duke/FCG) has packed the file (multiple times), so we have to unpack it before we can make changes.

I used Unp64 2.27 from here:
[http://csdb.dk/release/?id=110545](http://csdb.dk/release/?id=110545)

You will also need c1541.exe from Winvice in your path, or copied to your working folder.

We'll make a Windows batch file to handle the unpacking. Create a file called extract.bat and open it in notepad.

In the batch file, the first thing we need to do is extract the prg file from the .d64 and save it to our working folder, so add this line to the bat file:

c1541 -attach disk.d64 8 -read "helikopter jagd" output.prg

This will save the game to a file named output.prg. Now we can run this file through unp64 to unpack it. In this case, we need to run it through the unpacker a few times to unpack all the different levels of packing. The automated feature in unp64 (-c) to do this didnt work for me, so we will just do it manually. We keep unpacking until unp64 tells us its no longer packed.

To save you the time, it takes four runs through. So add the following lines to your bat file:

unp64 -v -l -o output1.prg output.prg del output.prg unp64 -v -l -o output2.prg output1.prg del output1.prg unp64 -v -l -o output3.prg output2.prg del output2.prg unp64 -v -l -o output4.prg output3.prg del output3.prg pause

The pause at the end is so you can look and find the entry-point before the window closes. We will need this address.

Once this is done, save and run the bat file. You should end up with only one file: output4.prg, this is the unpacked version.

While the window is still open, look at the last unpacking entry:

ECA Compacker, unpacker=$0100 ECA reloc active at $01da, from $d000-$efff to $e000-$ffff (use -l) Clean memory-end leftovers Entry point: $0811 pass1, find unpacker: $0100 Iterations 169811 cycles 673037 pass2, return to mem: $c000 Iterations 525343 cycles 2675443 ECA: endmem adjusted from $efff to $ffff mem $d000-$dfff cleaned saved $0900-$fffe as output4.prg

The Entry-Point listed here is the entry to the depacker routine and not the one we want. The “return to mem” value is the entry-point we need. In this case $c000.

Now open the output4.prg in winvice. It wont run properly yet, but thats ok, once its “running”, enter the monitor and pull up the disassembly window from the view menu.

Scroll to our entry-point location ($C000). You should see the following code. I've commented some important points:

.C:c000 A9 0E LDA #$0E .C:c002 8D 20 D0 STA $D020 ;change screen/bg color .C:c005 8D 21 D0 STA $D021 .C:c008 A9 04 LDA #$04 .C:c00a 8D 00 DD STA $DD00 .C:c00d A9 18 LDA #$18 .C:c00f 8D 18 D0 STA $D018 .C:c012 A9 D8 LDA #$D8 .C:c014 8D 16 D0 STA $D016 .C:c017 A9 3B LDA #$3B .C:c019 8D 11 D0 STA $D011 .C:c01c A2 00 LDX #$00 .C:c01e BD 00 C8 LDA $C800,X ;load title pic data .C:c021 9D 00 D8 STA $D800,X .C:c024 BD 00 C9 LDA $C900,X .C:c027 9D 00 D9 STA $D900,X .C:c02a BD 00 CA LDA $CA00,X .C:c02d 9D 00 DA STA $DA00,X .C:c030 BD 00 CB LDA $CB00,X .C:c033 9D 00 DB STA $DB00,X .C:c036 E8 INX .C:c037 E0 00 CPX #$00 .C:c039 D0 E3 BNE $C01E .C:c03b 20 9F FF JSR $FF9F .C:c03e 20 E4 FF JSR $FFE4 ;wait for keypress .C:c041 C9 20 CMP #$20 ;check if space bar pressed .C:c043 D0 F6 BNE $C03B ;loop wait for keypress .C:c045 A9 97 LDA #$97 ;space was pressed, continue .C:c047 8D 00 DD STA $DD00 .C:c04a A9 15 LDA #$15 .C:c04c 8D 18 D0 STA $D018 .C:c04f A9 C8 LDA #$C8 .C:c051 8D 16 D0 STA $D016 .C:c054 A9 1B LDA #$1B .C:c056 8D 11 D0 STA $D011 .C:c059 20 44 E5 JSR $E544 .C:c05c A2 00 LDX #$00 .C:c05e BD 7B C0 LDA $C07B,X .C:c061 9D E6 05 STA $05E6,X .C:c064 E8 INX .C:c065 E0 1A CPX #$1A ;doing some stuff we dont care about .C:c067 D0 F5 BNE $C05E .C:c069 A9 0E LDA #$0E .C:c06b 20 D2 FF JSR $FFD2 .C:c06e A2 00 LDX #$00 .C:c070 A9 00 LDA #$00 .C:c072 9D E0 D9 STA $D9E0,X .C:c075 E8 INX .C:c076 D0 F8 BNE $C070 .C:c078 4C 95 C0 JMP $C095 .C:c07b 50 41 BVC $C0BE .C:c081 20 42 59 JSR $5942 .C:c084 20 44 55 JSR $5544 .C:c087 4B 45 ASR #$45 .C:c089 20 4F 46 JSR $464F .C:c08c 20 46 43 JSR $4346 .C:c08f 47 20 SRE $20 .C:c091 31 39 AND ($39),Y .C:c093 34 31 NOOP $31,X .C:c095 A9 60 LDA #$60 .C:c097 85 AE STA $AE .C:c099 A9 72 LDA #$72 .C:c09b 85 AF STA $AF .C:c09d 4C 00 10 JMP $1000 ;and finally, jump to start of game

We can see following this last address, there is alot of BRK lines… This is empty space we can use for our trainer intro if we write one (a job for another tutorial).

Now we can insert our code to NOP out the DECrement line we covered earlier. Close the disassembly window, and leave the monitor open.

We will replace the JMP $1000 line with our code to modify the DEC instruction.

To start entering assembly code at c09d, where the JMP $1000 instruction is, type the following into the monitor:

a c09d

It is then ready for you to enter your assembly, type the following hitting enter after each line:

lda #$ea sta $1ff3 sta $1ff4 sta $1ff5 jmp $1000

When finished, hit enter on an empty line to exit assembly mode. We have now edited the DEC instruction before jumping to $1000. You can now type:

d c081

to see your modified code. (or use the disassembly window) Now we will take note of our new hex values and make the changes to the “output4.prg” file with a hex editor.

You should be looking at the following code:

.C:c097 85 AE STA $AE .C:c099 A9 72 LDA #$72 .C:c09b 85 AF STA $AF .C:c09d A9 EA LDA #$EA ;our changes start here .C:c09f 8D F3 1F STA $1FF3 .C:c0a2 8D F4 1F STA $1FF4 .C:c0a5 8D F5 1F STA $1FF5 .C:c0a8 4C 00 10 JMP $1000

Take note of the hex values of the three lines before our changed code. We will use this to find the correct place in the hex editor to put our new code. The hex for these three lines is:

85 AE A9 72 85 AF

Open output4.prg in any hex editor and search for those hex values. Once found, simply overwrite the bytes that follow it with your new bytes:

A9 EA 8D F3 1F 8D F4 1F 8D F5 1F 4C 00 10

You should now see this in your hex editor:

85 AE A9 72 85 AF A9 EA 8D F3 1F 8D F4 1F 8D F5 1F 4C 00 10

Save the changes to the file and we are ready to repack it and test it!

We'll use exomizer to pack the file, so from a command prompt type:

exomizer sfx $c000 -x 1 output4.prg -o final.prg

The $c000 tells exomizer where to start the program from after unpacking, this is the entry point we determined earlier. Once this is done, you will have a file called final.prg.

Open it up in WinVice and you will have unlimited lives…

Ideally, instead of just patching the bytes and jumping to $1000 like we've done you would code a small intro asking whether the user wanted unlimited lives and patch accordingly. Then append the intro to the same location we started our changes above. This process is left to the reader :)

I hope you find this useful. (and I hope I didnt make any mistakes).
