    OP CODE: TDC (Transfer Direct page register to 16-Bit aCcumulator)
    ==================================================================
    
    Addressing Modes:
        Implied                            ($7b - 1 byte, 2 cycles)
    Flags Affected:
        n - Set if most significant bit of transferred value is set; else
            cleared.
        z - Set if value transferred is zero; else cleared.
    Description:
        Transfer the value in the sixteen-bit direct page register D to the
        sixteen-bit accumulator C, regardless of the setting of the
        accumulator/memory mode flag.
        An alternate mnemonic is TDA (transfer the value in the direct page
        register to the A accumulator).
        In TDC, the “C” is used to indicate that sixteen bits are transferred
        regardless of the m flag. If the A accumulator is set to just eight
        bits (whether because the m flag is set, or because the processor is in
        6502 emulation mode), then it takes the value of the low byte of the
        direct page register and the hidden B accumulator takes the value of
        the high byte of the direct page register.
        The direct page register’s sixteen-bit value is unchanged by the
        operation.
    Notes:
