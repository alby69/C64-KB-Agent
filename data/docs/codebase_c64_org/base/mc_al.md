# Introduction

*This is part 1 of a machine-code and assembly language tutorial series for the 6510 by Rudi B. Stranden.*

`The Commodore 64 uses a microprocessor chip called the `.
**6510**

The 6510 is connected to a bus called the address-bus which has 16 wires. (The address-bus selects the memory chip).

The memory chip(s) are connected to the address-bus for selection and can send and retrieve data through a 8-bit data bus. There are also some extra wires (control bus) that controls a data timer and direction such as read/write.

**Address bus**: 16 bits (2^16 voltage combinations)

**Data bus**: 8 bits (2^8 voltage combinations)

## Binary quantities

So what is binary you may ask? Inside a computer there are circuits connected to different parts, components or inside chips. Most of these circuits may be in one of two states: zero or one. We can also call them states as True or false, Open or closed, Yes or no, etc. 1 and 0 are most commonly used because of their easy read- and writeability. So let's imagine a chip that has x-number of pins. If we work on 8 of these pins there are 8 wires going from and to these pins and their states have two possible voltages that represent either 1 or 0.

In a digital system binary information is represented by voltage-currents that is present in the inputs of the circuits that are being used. The two binary values 0 and 1 is represented by two nominal voltage-levels.

Diagram of standard TTL-circuit voltage levels:

```
  5V -------------.
      |           |
      | Binary: 1 |
      |           |
  2V -+-----------|
      | not used  |
0.8V -+-----------|
      | Binary: 0 |
  0V -------------'
```
On some 8-bit computers a binary number is often preceded by a percent sign. The Commodore 64 assembly language uses this representation of binary numbers.

**Example:  %11001101**

8 consecutive bits represents a byte. The byte can represent numbers from 0 to 255, hence 256 different possibilities.

## Chips

**RAM** (Random Access Memory): A place to store information. Read/Write.

**ROM** (Read Only Memory): Fixed sub-routines are stored in ROM that can do special tasks.

**IA** (Interface Adaptor): Contain functions as: input/output (I/O); timing devices; IRQs, video/sound. PIA, VIA, CIA, VIC and SID.

## Microprocessor Registers

Program Counter (PC): Tells where the next instruction will come from.

**Accumulator** (A), **X-Register** (X), **Y-Register** (Y): We may load and store a byte (8-bits) to any of these registers. Data in memory are passed via these three registers since there is no way of moving information between memory locations.

The Accumulator is a special register which can perform arithmetic operations which the x- and y-register cannot do. We'll get back to that later.

# Machine-code and Assembly

operation code: Assembly code: AD 00 08 LDA $0800 (AD is the op-code) (00 08 is the operand)

Operand is zero, one or two bytes long. In 2-byte operands (16-bits) the last byte comes first. Operands performs faster speed when they are only in zero-page (an 8-bit page) that ranges from $00 to $FF. Zero-page use much faster fetching and storing from and to these addresses. Low byte first is standard in the 6510.

We'll mostly work with the hexadecimal number-system. The dollar-sign ($) is a prefix to state that it is a hexadecimal number. We'll mostly deal with them when we work in assembly language, but we can also write binary numbers as we said earlier. A decimal number dont have a prefix in front of it.

## Load and Store into Data-registers

Example to swap bytes from two memory locations:

LDA $0800 - Load byte from memory location ($0800) into accumulator-register LDX $0801 - Load byte from memory location ($0801) into X-register STA $0801 - Store byte from accumulator into memory location $0801 STX $0800 - Store byte from x-register into memory location $0800

The values in the two memory locations are now swapped.

## Opcodes and instructions for Load and Store

Opcode: Instruction: 8C STY 8D STA 8E STX AC LDY AD LDA AE LDX

When you make a program it must be placed somewhere in **RAM**. To do that we can poke the values from Basic or use a Machine-code monitor. The later is more convenient since Basic language is slower and takes up more memory-space. However since Basic lies in **ROM** it cannot be removed, but individual basic routines takes up more space when you use them. `If you do poke values into memory from basic and want to run from an address you type `. However basic does not work with hexadecimal numbers so you need to convert them to decimal before you poke or sys them. Machine-code monitors and assemblers do most of the time handle hexadecimal numbers. After performing the SYS-command the machine code is running as fast as it should go with the instructions and operands that are fetched and stored from the address and data-busses. If you mix basic-language with machine-language it can some of the time run more slower because basic-routines have alot more instructions and does much more things that you usually dont need. If you want to make fast routines on the C64 i suggest you learn how to program machine-code or assembly because Basic is just too slow. However if you think assembly-language is hard to learn and you havent programmed before Basic may be a good excercise to learn elementary program logic.
**SYS** <*location*> to run from the specific address

## Status register

`The 6510 has an internal status register which contains all the flags the processor uses. There are seven processor status flags. These are: Carry flag, Zero flag, Interrupt flag, Decimal flag, Break flag, Overflow flag and the Negative flag.`

```
Bits:    7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
         | | | | | | | |
Flag:    N V - B D I Z C
```
Bit 5 is never used (has no flag).

We'll come back to these flags later. In this part we'll deal only with the zero- and carry-flag.

# Compare and branching

## Zero flag (z-flag)

The Zero-flag (z-flag) is a flag that is mostly used in comparsion with numbers. If the operand is equal to the value which lies inside a register the z-flag is set to on, otherwise its set to off. Comparing can be done by setting the operand with an immediate byte-value or with a byte stored at a specific memory location. In our examples below we use immediate values. An immediate value is set by the use of the #-sign in front of the operand.

**Compare example:**

CPX #$06 (If the x-register contains a value of $06, then the z-flag will be set to 1). CPY #$08 (If the y-register contains a value of something else than $08, then the z-flag will be set to 0). CMP #$02 (If the accumulator contains a value of $02 then the z-flag will be set to 1).

## Branching

We can choose to use a branch instruction to branch after a compare has been made, based on the value of one the status flags.

First compare with any of the registers. We'll use the x-register as an example.

```
LDX #$06     (We set the x-register to $06. The z-flag is reset to 0 here.
              If the operand was $00 the z-flag would be set to 1).
CPX #$06     (Compare the content of the x-register with the operand, in our case $06.
              The result from this compare sets the z-flag to 1).
BEQ $.....   (Branch to a memory address if z-flag is 1.
              In our case the z-flag is one and the branch takes place).
```
If the z-flag was set to 0, hence the value we compared was not equal to the value in the x-register the branch would not have taken place. Try it out for yourself by changing the values.

As you can see from above the LDX affect the z-flag. The same goes for LDY and LDA. However Store instructions like STA, STX and STY does not affect any flag. Branch instructions test flags but dont change them.

## The Branch instructions

BNE - Will branch if z-flag is zero. BEQ - Will branch if z-flag is one. BCS - Will branch if the value in the register is greater than or equal to the other value. BCC - Will branch if the value in the register is less than the other value.

The two latter branch-instructions does branch if the Carry flag is set or not set. (See below).

## The carry flag (c-flag)

After a comparsion (CPX, CPY or CMP) the carry flag (c-flag) is set to one if the register is greater than or equal to the compared value, otherwise it is not set.

BCS (branch carry set) - will branch if the carry is set. BCC (branch carry clear) - will branch if the carry is not set. SEC (set carry) CLC (clear carry)
