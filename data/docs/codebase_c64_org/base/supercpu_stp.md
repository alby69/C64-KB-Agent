# STP

                # STP

```
    /*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
    OP CODE: STP (SToP the processor)
    =================================
    
    Addressing Modes:
        Implied                            ($db - 1 byte, 3 cycles¹)
        ¹ - Uses 3 cycles to shut the processor down; additional cycles are
        required by reset to restart it
    Flags Affected:
        N/A
    Description:
        During the processor’s next phase 2 clock cycle, stop the processor’s
        oscillator input; the processor is effectively shut down until a reset
        occurs (until the RES’ pin is pulled low).
        STP is designed to put the processor to sleep while it’s not (actively)
        in use in order to reduce power consumption. Since power consumption is
        a function of frequency with CMOS circuits, stopping the clock cuts
        power to almost nil.
        Your reset handling routine (pointed to by the reset vector,
        $00:FFFC-FD) should be designed to either reinitialize the system or
        resume control through a previously-installed reset handler.
        Remember that reset is an interrupt-like signal that causes the
        emulation bit to be set to one. It also causes the direct page register
        to be reset to zero; stack high to be set to one (forcing the stack
        pointer to page one); and the mode select flags to be set to one
        (eight-bit registers; a side effect is that the high bytes of the index
        registers are zeroed). STP is useful only in hardware systems (such as
        battery-powered systems) specifically designed to support a low-power
        mode.
