    OP CODE: MVP (block MoVe Previous)
    ==============================
    
    Addressing Modes:
        Block Move                        ($44 - 3 bytes, * cycles)
        * 7 Cycles per byte moved.
    Flags Affected:
        N/A
    Description:
        Moves (copies) a block of memory to a new location. The source,
        destination and length operands of this instruction are taken from the
        X, Y, and C (double accumulator) registers; these should be loaded with
        the correct values before executing the MVP instruction.
        The source address for MVP, taken from the X register, should be the
        ending address (highest in memory) of the block to be moved. The
        destination address, in the Y register, should be the new ending
        address for the moved block. The length, loaded into the double
        accumulator (the value in C is always used, regardless of the setting
        of the m flag) should be the length of the block to be moved minus one;
        if C contains $0005, six bytes will be moved. The two operand bytes of
        the MVP instruction specify the banks holding the two blocks of memory:
        the first operand byte (of object code) specifies the destination bank;
        the second operand byte specifies the source bank.
        The execution sequence is: the first byte is moved from the address in
        X to the address in Y; then X and Y are decremented, C is decremented,
        and the previous byte is moved; this process continues until the number
        of bytes specified by the value in C plus one is moved. In other words,
        until the value in C is $FFFF.
        
        If the source and destination blocks do not overlap, then the source
        block remains intact after it has been copied to the destination.
        
        If the index registers are in eight-bit mode (x = 1), or the processor
        is in 6502 emulation mode (e = 1), then the blocks If the source and
        destination blocks do overlap, then MVP should be used only if the
        destination is higher than the source to avoid overwriting source bytes
        before they’ve been copied to the destination. If the destination is
        lower, then the MVN instruction should be used instead.
        When execution is complete, the value in C is $FFFF, registers X and Y
        each point one byte past the beginning of the blocks to which they were
        pointing, and the data bank register holds the destination bank value
        (the first operand byte).
        Assembler syntax for the block move instruction calls for the operand
        field to be coded as two addresses, source first, then destination
        – the move intuitive ordering, but the opposite of the actual operand
        order in the object code. The assembler strips the bank bytes from the
        addresses (ignoring the rest) and reverses them to object code order.
        If a block move instruction is interrupted, it may be resumed
        automatically via execution of an RTI if all of the registers are
        restored or intact. The value pushed onto the stack when a block move
        is interrupted is the address of the block move instruction. The
        current byte-move is completed before the interrupt is serviced.
        If the index registers are in eight-bit mode (x = 1), or the processor
        is in 6502 emulation mode (e = 1), then the blocks being specified must
        necessarily be in page zero since the high bytes of the index registers
        will contain zeroes.

    Description:
        Moves (copies) a block of memory to a new location. The source,
        destination and length operands of this instruction are taken from the
        X, Y, and C (double accumulator) registers; these should be loaded with
        the correct values before executing the MVP instruction.

        The source address for MVP, taken from the X register, should be the
        ending address (highest in memory) of the block to be moved. The
        destination address, in the Y register, should be the new ending
        address for the moved block. The length, loaded into the double
        accumulator (the value in C is always used, regardless of the setting

        the MVP instruction specify the banks holding the two blocks of memory:
