# DTV DMA SID digi player experiment

This is my little experiment (and my first try to do anything with the DTV) to play digi on the DTV without using the CPU.

## The idea itself

This text was originally published [here](http://cubed-borka.blogspot.com/2011/02/audio-sample-playback-on-c64dtv-without.html)
.

DTV makes it easy to play digital sample back, since DtvSID has the “waveform accumlator” register ($D41E). It's interesting to note, that recently even on a plain C64 someone can play 8 bit samples. However my tries now are about using the DTV with freeing the CPU from doing the thing (surely, it's impossible on C64). If you ever programmed a sound card on PC, you know that it's quite comfortable that you can use the DMA capability of the sound card, so you don't need to this with keeping attention with all of your CPU on the process … Since DTV has DMA, I was curious if I can do this there. And yes, I can.

Let's say I store sample in flash. I have to program DMA to read bytes from the flash and write them into register $D41E. Since it's possible to give zero as the destination step, it's not so complicated to find the solution to write samples one by one to the very same destination byte all the time. Cool. However one problem remains: DMA is “too fast”, it would be quite extreme sampling rate if you try this. Fortunately, DTV's DMA can help, again. It has the “modulo” capability which was designed to copy for example rectangular screen areas: copying X bytes, then add Y to the source (or destination), and so on. My solution is setting up the source step to zero, and line length to a value which is needed to have the same sample byte before using the next one. Playback sample rate is set up with giving the right “line length” value for the DMA. Modulo is set to one. So, after repeating the same byte, DMA will copy the next byte. The last thing in the game is to set up the “end DMA” IRQ. In the IRQ handler I simply program the DMA to continue (source continue on) the transfer. It's needed, since DMA can't do move more data than 64k.

As you can see, audio playback is done by the DMA, and IRQ is involved the eliminate the maximal DMA transfer size, where IRQ is triggered by the end of DMA transfer. This way, you are free to do anything with the CPU, while you have audio playback in the background. I think one issue can remain though: issuing the IRQ and reprogramming the DMA (actually it's just two LDA/STA opcodes, but still, accepting the IRQ needs some cycles) causes to have audible problems during the playback.

One thing: “speed of the DMA” have to be stable, which is not the case if other system components steal some cycles. So you should not use blitter meanwhile, also you should avoid VIC's color- and sprite data fetches (it sounds quite odd, otherwise). I have experienced this, simply switch off VIC (or disabling color fetches) worked the problem around. It's not so fun, to have switched of VIC, since the main advantage would be having “free to do anything” feeling during the playback. However you can use video modes where there is no color fetch. It seems, 320*200 256 color mode is great for it, also I can show nice images during the playback :) Also, you can try to disable “bad line emulation”.
