    OP CODE: PER (Push Effective PC Relative indirect address)
    ==========================================================
    
    Addressing Modes:
        Stack (PC Relative Long)         ($62 - 3 bytes, 6 cycles)
    Flags Affected:
        N/A
    Description:
        Add the current value of the program counter to the sixteen-bit signed
        displacement in the operand, and push the result on the stack. This
        operation always pushes sixteen bits of data, irrespective of the
        settings of the m and x mode select flags.
        The high byte of the sum is pushed first, then the low byte is pushed.
        After the instruction is completed, the stack pointer points to the
        next available stack location, immediately below the last by pushed.
        Because PER’s operand is a displacement relative to the current value
        of the program counter (as with the branch instructions), this
        instruction is helpful in writing self-relocatable code in which an
        address within the program (typically of a data area) must be accessed.
        The address pushed onto the stack will be the run-time address of the
        data area, regardless of where the program was loaded in memory; it may
        be pulled into a register, stored in an indirect pointer, or used on
        the stack with the stack relative indirect indexed addressing mode to
        access the data at that location.
        As is the case with the branch instructions, the syntax used is to
        specify as the operand the label of the data area you want to
        reference. This location must be in the program bank, since the
        displacement is relative to the program counter. The assembler
        converts the assembly-time label into a displacement from the
        assembly-time address of the next instruction.
        The value of the program counter used in the addition is the address of
        the next instruction, that is, the instruction following the PER
        instruction.
        PER may also be used to push return addresses on the stack, either as
        part of a simulated branch-to subroutine or to place the return address
        beneath the stacked parameters to a subroutine call; always remember
        that a pushed return address should be the desired return address minus
        one.
    Notes:
        VICE Emulator monitor does not handle the relative offset addressing.
        Example code:
                            .pc = $2000
            2000 62 fd 7f   :per Data1      // Push run-time address of Data1
            2003 e2 20      :sep #$20       // A = 8 bit
            2005 a0 00 00   :ldy #$0000     // Zero Index Y
            2008 b3 01      :lda (1,S),y    // load A from Data1 (1,s & 2,s)
                            .pc = $2500
            Data0:          .byte $2a, $2a, $2a
            Data1:          .byte $ff
            Data2:          .byte $f7
            Data3:          .byte $e3
            This code & data is fully relocatable.
            Emulator monitor sets absolute address instead of relative (should
            do be same as :bra)
