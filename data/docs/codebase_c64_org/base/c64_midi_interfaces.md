# MIDI Interfaces

Here is a list of Interfaces, 6850 UART registers and the most important values you will be feeding the Control Register with.

| SEQUENTIAL CIRCUITS INC. | ||
|---|---|---|
| Mode | 1 MHZ IRQ | |
| Control Register | $DE00 | Write only | 
| Status Register | $DE02 | Read only | 
| Transmit Data (Tx) | $DE01 | Write only | 
| Receive Data (Rx) | $DE03 | Read only | 
| Midi Reset | $03 | Master Reset | 
| Midi Enable | $15 | Word Select & Counter Divide | 
| Midi IRQ Enable | $95 | IRQ ON, Word Select & Counter Divide | 

| PASSPORT & SENTECH | ||
|---|---|---|
| Mode | 1 MHZ IRQ | |

- Datel/Siel/JMS/C-LAB runs at 2 mhz. A C64 needs a different Counter Divide to keep up.
- The Namesoft device requires a NMI interrupt for reading Midi data.

## The Control Register (Write only)

```
Bit 7 (Receive Interrupt Enable):
    1  Enable interrupt.
    0  Disable interrupt.
       The following interrupts will be enabled when set high:
       * Receive Data Register Full
       * Receiver Overrun
       * A low-to-high transition on the Data Carrier Detect (DCD) signal line
            
	
Bit 6 & 5 (Transmit Control):
    0   0  RTS = Low  Transmitting Interrupt Disabled.
    0   1  RTS = Low  Transmitting Interrupt Enabled.
    1   0  RTS = High Transmitting Interrupt Disabled.
    1   1  RTS = Low  Transmits a Break level on the Transmit Data Output.
                      Transmitting Interrupt Disabled.
	                     
           The transmit Control bits controls the RTS (Request To Send)
           output line. Active state = Low RTS. 
           By enabling bit 5 you can generate a interrupt for transmitting data 
           to other peripherals.
           (Another way of transmitting data is polling.)
                  
Bit 4,3,2 (Word Select):
    0 0 0  7 Bits + Even Parity + 2 Stop Bits
    0 0 1  7 Bits + Odd Parity  + 2 Stops Bits
    0 1 0  7 Bits + Even Parity + 1 Stop Bit
    0 1 1  7 Bits + Odd Parity  + 1 Stop Bit
    1 0 0  8 Bits + No Parity   + 2 Stop Bits
    1 0 1  8 Bits + No Parity   + 1 Stop Bit
    1 1 0  8 Bits + Even Parity + 1 Stop Bit
    1 1 1  8 Bits + Odd Parity  + 1 Stop Bit
Bit 1 & 0 (Counter Divide Select):
    0   0  Divide by 1.
    0   1  Divide by 16.
    1   0  Divide by 64.   
    1   1  Master Reset.
           After a power on these bits must be set high to reset the ACIA.
           After resetting, the clock divide ratios may be selected.
```
## The Status Register (Read Only)

```
Bit 7 (Interrupt Request)
    0  Interrupt is off - nothing to do.
    1  Interrupt is on.
       This bit is turned when:
       * Receive Data Register Full (RDRF) is turned on.
       * Transmit Data Register Empty (TDRE) is turned on.
       * Receiver Overrun (OVRN) is turned on.
       This bit is cleared by reading the Rx register or
       writing to the Tx register.
Bit 6 (Parity Error)       
    0  No error
    1  Parity error, depends on Word Select.
       If no parity is selected : Both transmit parity and receive parity
       check results are ignored.
Bit 5 (Receiver Overrun)
    0  No error
    1  Error
       Overrun is an error flag that indicates that one or more characters in
       the data stream were lost. The Overrun indication is reset after
       reading the Rx register or by a Master Reset.
Bit 4 (Framing Error)
    0  No error
    1  Error
       Framing error indicates that the received character is improperly framed
       by a start and a stop bit. Which means Synchronization error (see counter divide),
       faulty transmission or a break condition  This error is only present until a
       new character is present in the Rx register.
       
Bit 3 (Clear to Send)
    0  Modem is ready to receive.
    1  Modem is not ready.
       This bit indicates the state of Clear to Send from a modem.
       When this bit is on the TDRE bit is ignored.
       Master reset does not affect this bit.
Bit 2 (Data Carrier Detect)
    0  no modem input.
    1  DCD input from a modem - Causes an Interrupt.
       This bit can be turned off by reading the Status register followed by the Rx register.
       A master reset will also clear this bit.
Bit 1 (Transmit Data Register Empty)
    0  The Tx Register is not ready for writing.
    1  The Tx Register is ready.
       To write to the Tx Register you have to check if this bit is high.
       Example - polling:
       
             pha
       wait  lda Status Register
             and #2
             beq wait
             pla
             sta Tx
             rts
Bit 0 (Receive Data Register Full)
    0  The Rx Register is not ready for reading.
    1  The Rx Register is ready.
       To read from the Rx register you have to check if this bit is high
       This bit is cleared after a master reset or a read from the Rx register.
       Example - polling:
       
       wait  lda Status Register
             lsr
             bcc wait
             lda Rx
             rts
    
```
## The Tx Register (Write Only)

In this register you store the byte you want to transmit. Note that you must check the TDRE bit is high before writing.

## The Rx Register (Read Only)

In this register you read the byte your received. Note that you must check the RDRF bit is high before reading.
