    OP CODE: STZ (STore Zero to memory)
    ===================================
    
    Addressing Modes:
        Absolute                        ($9c - 3 bytes, 4 cycles¹)
        Direct Page                     ($64 - 2 bytes, 3 cycles¹²)
        Absolute Indexed,x              ($9e - 3 bytes, 5 cycles¹)
        Direct Page Indexed,x           ($74 - 2 bytes, 4 cycles¹²)
        ¹ - Add 1 cycle if m=0 (16-bit memory/accumulator)
        ² - Add 1 cycle if lo-byte of DP register is other than zero (DL< >0)
    Flags Affected:
        N/A
    Description:
        The STZ instructions, introduced on the 65C02, lets you clear either a
        single or double byte memory word zero, depending, as usual, on the
        current memory/accumulator select flag word size. Zero has long been
        recognized as one of the most commonly stored values, so a “dedicated”
        instruction to store zero to memory can improve the efficiency of many
        65x programs. Furthermore, the STZ instruction lets you clear memory
        without having to first load one of the registers with zero. Using STZ
        results in fewer bytes of code, faster execution, and undisturbed
        registers.
        Store zero to the effective address specified by the operand.
        8-bit accumulator (all processors): Zero is stored at the effective
        address.
        16-bit accumulator/memory (65802/65816 only, m = 0): Zero is stored at
        the effective address and at the effective address plus one.
        The 65x store zero instruction does not affect the flags.
    Notes:
        The Pseudo don't recognize ZP / ZP,x commands (< 256), so a workaround
        is done by checking the actual value which is passed.
