# BRA / BRL

base:supercpu_bra

                # BRA / BRL

This pseudocommand merges both BRA and BRL opcommands and chooses automatically which one to use.

```
    //---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    // PseudoCommand-OPC: BRA (BRanch Always)
    //
    // Addressing Modes:
    //   Program Counter Relative                ($80 - 2 bytes, 3 cycles¹)
    //   Program Counter Relative Long           ($82 - 3 bytes, 4 cycles)
    //   ¹ - Add 1 cycle if branch crosses page boundary on 65C02 or in 65816/65802’s 6502
    //       emulation mode (e = 1)
    //
    // Flags Affected:
    //   N/A
    //
    // Description - BRA:
    //   A branch is always taken, and no testing is done: in effect, an unconditional JMP is
    //   executed, but since signed displacements are used, the instruction is only two bytes,
    //   rather than the three bytes of a JMP. Additionally, using displacements from the program
    //   counter makes the BRA instruction relocatable. Unlike a JMP instruction, the BRA is
    //   limited to targets that lie within the range of the one-byte signed displacement of the
    //   conditional branches: - 128 to + 127 bytes from the first byte following the BRA
    //   instruction.
    //
    //   To branch, a one-byte signed displacement, fetched from the second byte of the
    //   instruction, is signextended to sixteen bits and added to the program counter. Once the
    //   branch address has been calculated, the result is loaded into the program counter,
    //   transferring control to that location.
    //
    // Description - BRL:
    //   A branch is always taken, similar to the BRA instruction. However, BRL is a three-byte
    //   instruction; the two bytes immediately following the opcode form a sixteen-bit signed
    //   displacement from the program counter. Once the branch address has been calculated, the
    //   result is loaded into the program counter, transferring control to that location.
    //
    //   The allowable range of the displacement is anywhere within the current 64K program bank.
    //
    //   The long branch provides an unconditional transfer of control similar to the JMP
    //   instruction, with one major advantage: the branch instruction is relocatable while jump
    //   instructions are not. However, the (nonrelocatable) jump absolute instruction executes one
    //   cycle faster.
    //
    // Notes:
    //   BRL & BRA is the same, just different relative range. Incorporated into one OPCommand.
    //   Boundary conditions checked and work correctly!
    //   Has this "unresolved label" bug when branching forwards. Do not understand as this surely
    //   worked before. Not sure if this will ever be fixed. Substitute with JMP for now.
    //---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    .pseudocommand bra val {
        .if(val.getValue() < *-2) {              // Check if branching to lower or higher address
            .if(val.getValue()-*-2 < -128) {     // Branching to a lower address, Check BRA/BRL
                .byte $82, <val.getValue()-*-3, >val.getValue()-*-3 // Branch out of range, use BRL
