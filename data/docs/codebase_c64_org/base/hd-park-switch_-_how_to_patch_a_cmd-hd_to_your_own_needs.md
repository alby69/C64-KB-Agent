(or How to Patch a CMD-HD to your own needs)

One thing I really like about the C64 nowadays is that it is a quiet computer. No fans or similar, just wonderful! Unfortunately, the SCSI-HDD inside my CMD-HD is the opposite. When it is running, it sounds like an aeroplane. Being a curious programmer, I tried to get rid of this annoyance. I realised that I never use the 'Write protect' button. So, maybe I could abuse it to park/unpark my HDD?

Well, the forthcoming project might not be too useful for most of you. Nevertheless, it might give you an idea how the CMD-HD works and how to apply own patches to the CMD-HD-ROM. You never know when you might need that!

# How to do

First of all, the HD-ROM is not really ROM but in fact RAM which can be protected from storing data to it. This makes sense, as the HD-KERNAL has to be loaded from the system partition when the HD boots up. Furthermore, upgrading the HD-DOS does not require hardware modifications. Ofcourse, it also means that applying patches is pretty easy: unprotect RAM, modify KERNAL, protect RAM. If the 1541 had such capabilities…

The patch itself is quite simple. Install a backpack to that point where the 'Write protect'-flag was toggled. From there, send the corresponding SCSI-jobcode to park/unpark the HD-mechanism. Finally go back to the standard procedure.

ROM-versions 1.86, 1.90 and 1.92 are handled (are there any more though?), though only 1.92 was tested. As we do just easy stuff, I do not expect many problems with those older versions. For the rest, I will let the source-code speak (I assume you know a little about sending and executing drive code. All necessary information was re-engineered (and that was the main work) by me or Doc Bacardi/The Dreams

Enjoy and comments are welcome.
