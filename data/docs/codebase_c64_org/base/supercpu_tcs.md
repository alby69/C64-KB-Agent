    OP CODE: TCS (Transfer aCcumulator to Stack pointer)
    ====================================================
    
    Addressing Modes:
        Implied                            ($1b - 1 byte, 2 cycles)
    Flags Affected:
        N/A
    Description:
        Transfer the value in the accumulator to the stack pointer S. The
        accumulator’s value is unchanged by the operation.
        An alternate mnemonic is TAS (transfer the value in the A accumulator
        to the stack pointer).
        In TCS, the “C” is used to indicate that, in native mode, sixteen bits
        are transferred regardless of the m flag. If the A accumulator is set
        to just eight bits (because the m flag is set), then its value is
        transferred to the low byte of the stack pointer and the value in the
        hidden B accumulator is transferred to the high byte of the stack
        pointer. In emulation mode, only the eight-bit A accumulator is
        transferred, since the high stack pointer byte is forced to one (the
        stack is confined to page one).
        TCS, along with TXS, are the only two instructions for changing the
        value in the stack pointer. The two are also the only two transfer
        instructions not to alter the flags.
