# Writing a sector to disk

# Writing a sector to disk

For writing a sector to disk, the Commodore DOS offers the block write command. Due to heavy bugs in the B-W command, Commodore has sacrificed one of the user commands as a bugfix replacement. So instead of B-W you simply use U2.

The format of this DOS command is: “U2 <channel> <drive> <track> <sector>”

The drive parameter is only used for dual disk drives, so for all common C64/C128/C16 drives this parameter will always be 0.

Parameters track and sector explain themselves. They are sent in PETSCII format, so in assembler often a binary to PETSCII conversion is needed.

A speciality of this command is the channel parameter. Actually you can't simply send this command to the drive and then start to send sector bytes. For the sending of the bytes you have to open another file which is adressed by this parameter.

Before you send bytes into the channel buffer, it is neccessary to set the buffer pointer to 0 via the B-P command.

BASIC code:

10 SA=8192 20 OPEN 2,8,2,"#" 30 OPEN 15,8,15,"B-P 2 0" 40 FOR I=0 TO 255 50 A=PEEK(SA):SA=SA+1 60 PRINT#2,CHR$(A); 70 NEXT I 80 PRINT#15,"U2 2 0 18 0" 90 CLOSE 15:CLOSE 2

Assembler code:

```
sector_address = $2000  ; just an example
        ; open the channel file
        LDA #cname_end-cname
        LDX #<cname
        LDY #>cname
        JSR $FFBD     ; call SETNAM

        JSR $FFBA     ; call SETLFS
        JSR $FFC0     ; call OPEN
        BCS .error    ; if carry set, the file could not be opened

        BCS .error    ; if carry set, the file could not be opened
        ; check drive error channel here to test for
        ; FILE NOT FOUND error etc.
        LDX #$02      ; filenumber 2
        JSR $FFC9     ; call CHKOUT (file 2 now used as output)
        LDA #<sector_address
        STA $AE
        LDA #>sector_address
        STA $AF

        JSR $FFD2     ; call CHROUT (write byte to channel buffer)
        INY

        INY
        CPY #bwcmd_end-bwcmd
        BNE .loop2    ; next byte, end when 256 bytes are read
.close
        JSR $FFCC     ; call CLRCHN
