    OP CODE: PLY (PulL index register Y from stack)
    ===============================================
    
    Addressing Modes:
        Stack                            ($7a - 1 byte, 4 cycles¹)
        ¹ - Add 1 cycle if x = 0 (16-bit index registers)
    Flags Affected:
        n - Set if most significant bit of pulled value is set; else cleared.
        z - Set if value pulled is zero; else cleared.
    Description:
        Pull the value on the top of the stack into the Y index register. The
        previous contents of the register are destroyed.
        8-bit index registers (all processors): The stack pointer is first
        incremented. Then the byte pointed to by the stack pointer is loaded
        into the register.
        16-bit index registers (65802/65816 only, x = 0): Both bytes of the
        index register are pulled. First the low-order byte of the index
        register is pulled, then the high-order byte of the index register is
        pulled.
        Unlike some other microprocessors, the 65x instructions to pull an
        index register affect the negative and zero flags.
    Notes:
