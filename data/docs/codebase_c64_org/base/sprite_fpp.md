# Sprite FPP

# Sprite FPP

The basic theory behind a Sprite FPP is quite simple: Change sprite-pointer value every rasterline. Though there are a few things to prepare before it works in reality.

First we want to use a bigger graphics area than one sprite. With a normal [$d017-stretcher](https://codebase.c64.org/doku.php?id=base:stretching_sprites) we can make the sprites arbitrary high, and at the same time we only use one line of the sprite for graphics. If we then place our 8 sprites beside eachother, increasing the y-position by 1 for each sprite, then our FPP will display different graphics for each sprite. We have a 192 pixels wide sprite-layer with any desired height.

Note that all sprite-pointers have to be set each line for the FPP to work as we wish. Since they all use different lines of the sprite, the same value can be set to all sprite pointers. Using all 8 sprites, there will be 44 cycles availible each line for you to do this, and the $d017-stretching. Unrolled code is about the only option. There is no time for badlines here, so mostly you will need to use the $d011 idle-mode, which requires opening the upper/lower borders.

In the following code example i have kept it simple by using a loop for the FPP. Thus not all 8 sprites are being updated, only 6, so i save some cycles there to be able to loop the code. “FppCalc” is just a st0pid routine that generates some values to the FPP-table. Here you can do the real beauty of the effect by putting some more effort to it :).
