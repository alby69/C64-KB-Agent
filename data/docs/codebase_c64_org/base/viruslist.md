# Making a Virus Scanner - info needed

as some of you might know i made a little util to scan the disks i transfered 
for errors (D64scan v0.2, [http://noname.c64.org/csdb/release/?id=43862](http://noname.c64.org/csdb/release/?id=43862)). 

i thought it would be a useful feature to add virus detection (and possibly elimination) to that tool aswell…

so the question is, who has detailed info on that subject? useful info would be - what virii do exist - how did said virii work - what are existing scanners/cleaners, and how do they work - how do those virii “initially” install

…etc.

at the very least, i'd need a bunch of “infected” disks (or well, d64s of them), but ofcourse any further info would make things a lot easier :)

the following is a work in progress list of info that i could locate so far.

if you have anything to share that isnt mentioned in this list yet, (especially virus programs, and scanners/killers) don't hesitate to send me a mail also if you feel like adding more comments to one of the disassemblies, feel free to do so, all help is welcomed!

# Commodore C64 Virus List v0.2, last updated 09/06/2007 (w) groepaz/hitmen

## programs that qualify as "real" virus

### BHP-Virus

Author: Dr.Dr.Strobe & Papa Hacker & Garfield Size: 2030 bytes. (9 Blocks) Type: Memory-resident parasitic prepender. Infects: Commodore 64 Basic files. Payload: Displays text under certain conditions: DR.DR.STROBE&PAPA HACKER WAS HERE! COPROGRAMMER: GARFIELD HALLO DICKERCHEN, DIES IST EIN ECHTER VIRUS! SERIALNO.:2

Removal:

first virus for the C64 ever, often said to be _the_ first virus in computer history ever (which is not true, there were others before for cp/m, the apple 2e etc).

9 "bhp virus.prg" prg

The following description is a cleaned up and shortened summary of the symantec 
virus bulletin january 2005 ([http://pferrie.tripod.com/papers/bhp.pdf](http://pferrie.tripod.com/papers/bhp.pdf))

(note: this is still messy and may contain errors)

As with all Commodore 64 programs, BHP began with some code written in Basic. This code consisted of a single line, a SYS call to the assembler code, where the rest of the virus resided. Unlike many programs, the virus code built the address to call dynamically. This may have been written by a very careful coder, but it proved to be unnecessary because the address did not change in later versions of the machine.

Once the assembler code gained control, it placed itself in the block of memory that was normally occupied by the I/O devices when the ROM was banked-in.

A side-effect of memory-banking was that it was a great way to hide a program, since the program was not visible if its memory was not banked in. This is the reason why BHP placed its code in banked memory. After copying itself to banked memory, the virus restored the host program to its original memory location and restored the program size to its original value. This allowed the host program to execute as though it were not infected. However, at this time the virus would verify the checksum of the virus?s Basic code, and would overwrite the host memory if the checksum did not match. An interesting note about the checksum routine is that it missed the first three bytes of the code, which were the line number and SYS command. This made the job easier for the person who produced the later variant of the virus. Although the later variant differed only in the line number, this was sufficient to defeat the BHP-Killer program, because BHP-Killer checked the entire Basic code, including the line number.

The virus checked whether it was running already by reading a byte from a specific memory location. If that value matched the expected value, the virus assumed that another copy was running. Thus, writing that value to that memory location would have been an effective inoculation method. If no other copy of the virus was running, the virus would copy some code into a low address in non-banked memory, and hook several vectors, pointing them to the copied code.

The virus hooked the ILOAD, ISAVE, MAIN, NMI, CBINV and RESET vectors. The hooking of MAIN, NMI, CBINV and RESET made the virus Break-proof, Reset-proof, and Run/Stop-Restore-proof.

Once the hooks were in place, the virus ran the host code. The main virus code would be called on every request to load or save a file.

The ILOAD hook was reached when a disk needed to be searched. This happened whenever a directory listing was requested, and could happen when a search was made using a filename with wildcards, or the first time that a file was accessed. Otherwise, the drive hardware cached up to 2kb of data and returned it directly. The virus called the original ILOAD handler, then checked whether an infected program had been loaded. If an infected program had been loaded, the virus restored the host program to its original memory location and restored the program size to its original value. Otherwise, even if no file had been loaded, the virus called the infection routine.

The ISAVE hook was reached whenever a file was saved. The virus called the original ISAVE handler to save the file, then called the infection routine. The infection routine began by checking that the requested device was a disk drive. If so, then the virus opened the first file in the cache. The first file in the cache would be the saved file if this code was reached via the ISAVE hook, otherwise it would be the first file in the directory listing. If the file was a Basic program, then the virus performed a quick infection check by reading the first byte of the program and comparing it against the SYS command.

If the SYS command was present, the virus verified the infection by reading and comparing up to 27 subsequent bytes. A file was considered infected if all 27 bytes matched. If the file was not infected, the virus switched to reading data from the hardware cache. The first check was for a standard disk layout: the directory had to exist on track 18, sector 0, and the file to infect had not to have resided on that track.

If these checks passed, the virus searched the track list for free sectors. It began with the track containing the file to infect, then moved outwards in alternating directions. This reduced the amount of seeking that the drive had to perform in order to read the file afterwards.

If at least eight free sectors existed on the same track, then the virus allocated eight sectors for itself and updated the sector bitmap for that track.

The virus wrote itself to disk in the following manner: the first sector of the host was copied to the last sector allocated by the virus, then that first sector was replaced by the first sector of the virus. After that, the remaining virus code was written to the remaining allocated sectors.

The directory stealth was present here, and it existed without any effort on the part of the virus writer(s). It was a side-effect of the virus not updating the block count in the directory sector. The block count was not used by DOS to load files, its purpose was informational only, since it was displayed by the directory listing.

After any call to ILOAD or ISAVE, the virus checked whether the payload should activate. The conditions for the payload activation were the following: that the machine was operating in ?direct? mode (the command-prompt), that the seconds field of the jiffy clock was a value from 2?4 seconds, and that the current scan line of the vertical retrace was at least 128. This made the activation fairly random. The payload was to display a particular text, one character at a time, while cycling the colours of the border The serial number that was displayed was the number of times the payload check was called. It was incremented once after each call, and it was carried in replications. It reset to zero only after 65,536 calls.

### HIV-Virus

Author: Rogue/The Cult

probably the most known and widespread virus on the C64.

21 "hiv virus /cult" prg (turbo copy infected with hiv) 3 "hiv-virus" prg

The infection stored on the track 18.

It infects only the first 4 file on the disk. It stores the infections on the track 18 sector 0. In this sector the lower nibble of $A7 byte (XXXX0001 means the first file is infected, XXXX0011 means the first and second infected). After the 4th infection, infects the next (5th) file, and deletes the first file.

Software protection: Software protection is partially possible, just set the $A7 byte to XXXX1111 on a disk. If the virus is in the memory, but not was started with RUN command, but we insert another disk with this byte set, the virus assumes, its code already in the directory. Just tries to look for files, delete one, but does not writes its code into the directory.

The virus is 2 block long only, and after an infection, it recovers the original program and starts.

It is possible to copy an infected file with a file copy, so its not impossible to have a file which is infected more than one.

One of the virus scanners scans for this copied behaviour, and displays as file infection type (-F- )not as directory infection type (-D-), and of course we can have a file, which have also a directory type infection, and also as copied file another infection too. (This kind of multiple infection was named as -A- infection type in that scanner.)

Excellent programing work from the author of this virus.

### HIV2-Virus

Author: Crossbow/Crest

this is an “optimized” version of the HIV Virus. according to crossbow he never released it into “the wild”, however according to others it is “out there”.

HIV-EXPERT V2.0.prg (hiv expert 1.0 infected with HIV2)

crossbow comments on this one:

“here is my virus, it's contained in the scanner for HIV 1. it scanns the disk for HIV1 (and removes it when it is found) but infects with HIV2. the virus does not use track 18 for itself (like HIV1), but track 19. that way the HIV1 scanner can not find it - but it will likely destroy other programs.”

### BU\A Virus

aka: BULA Virus

Author: ?

8 "md!-virus" prg 29 "mdv-source" prg 44 "mdv-source.asc" seq

### Starfire-Virus

Author: ?

2 "starfire virus" prg

description by Quetzal:

That virus worked by scanning the directory for uninfected programs, grabbing the track + sector link to said prg and replacing it with a T+S link to a copy of the virus (which allocated each copy of itself 2 sectors on the disk more or less at random, thus REALLY screwing up files at times), the original T+S link was placed in the 2nd sector of the virus, so the original prg was then appended after it. Next time that prg was run, after the virus finished its work, a simple memory move to $0801 and a RUN, started the main prg. Can't recall exactly, but I think it also patched various vectors such as LOAD, RUNSTOP/RESTORE etc, giving more chances to be activated, this seems to be a common idea in C64 virus.

### FROG-Virus

Author: Kobold/Frogs

this one is kinda nasty, it installs the infection routine in a fastcrueled program, and thus is a lot harder to scan for than for other virii (the infected program must be unpacked to check for the infection routine)

38 "fastcruel4.0+frg" prg

### Coder-Virus

Author: ?

(currently only found a scanner/remover for this one, not the actual virus. there is a small chance that its a fake. need to analyze the scanner, however it is a basic-boss compiled program which is almost impossible to read without a lot of effort, so that has to wait - finding the virus itself would save a LOT of work!)

## Offtopic: pranks and fakes and other generally harmless programs

the following programs are listed to avoid confusion with “real” virii. they are all 100% harmless (promised).

### Antivirus V4.0

Quetzal comments on this one: “This is a well designed fake. The code for “checking” for a virus consists of randomly choosing from the list of available viruses - most of which I doubt ever existed.”
