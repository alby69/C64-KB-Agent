# Scoring points

by Achim

There are three ways to code scoring.

## 1) Decimal mode

This one can be found in many games. You only have to declare a couple of variables for the player's score and switch to decimal mode.

Example for six digits:

sed //set decimal mode clc lda #$50 //50 points scored adc score1 //ones and tens sta score1 lda score2 //hundreds and thousands adc #00 sta score2 lda score3 //ten-thousands and hundred-thousands adc #00 sta score3 cld //clear decimal mode

The score can now be printed on screen:

lda score3 and #$f0 //hundred-thousands lsr lsr lsr lsr ora #$30 // -->ascii sta screenposition //print on screen lda score3 and #$0f //ten-thousands ora #$30 // -->ascii sta screenposition+1 //print on next screen position lda score2 //same procedure for all digits ...

Switching to decimal mode can cause problems under certain conditions: Let's say an irq kicks in to write sprite registers while decimal mode is set. This would mess up all registers, of course. This might happen with a sprite mulitplexer, because these irqs are unpredictable. Idea would be to start these irqs with CLD. Another would be to disable irqs while calculating.

## 2) Hexadecimal mode

Not much to explain. Declare your variables for the score. Use a standard hexadecimal addition
and print the result on screen (preferably with a routine like [this](https://codebase.c64.org/doku.php?id=base:32_bit_hexadecimal_to_decimal_conversion), which converts hexadecimal to decimal, then ascii).

## 3) ASCII

This one's most commonly used in games. Each ascii code on screen is treated like a digit. An addition would look like this:

ldx #$05 lda #$00 !: sta carry,x //clear carry table dex bpl !- ldx #$05 //6 digits !: lda figure1,x //current score, usually located in screen memory clc adc figure2,x //add points adc carry,x and #$0f //check bits0-3 cmp #$0a //if >=10 bcc nocarry inc carry-1,x //then set carry for next digit... sec sbc #$0a //... -10 for correct ascii nocarry: ora #$30 //-->ascii sta sum,x dex bpl !- rts figure1: .byte $31, $32, $30, $33, $37, $39 // 120379 (example) figure2: .byte $32, $32, $30, $39, $32, $31 // +220921 carry: .byte $00, $00, $00, $00, $00, $00 //tmp for carry sum: .byte $00, $00, $00, $00, $00, $00

### Snippet Codice (Dialetto: Generic Assembly)

```assembly
sed		//set decimal mode
clc
lda #$50	//50 points scored
adc score1	//ones and tens
sta score1
lda score2	//hundreds and thousands
adc #00
sta score2
lda score3	//ten-thousands and hundred-thousands
adc #00
sta score3
cld		//clear decimal mode
```

### Snippet Codice (BASIC)

```basic
lda score3
and #$f0	        //hundred-thousands
lsr
lsr
lsr
lsr
ora #$30		// -->ascii
sta screenposition	//print on screen
lda score3
and #$0f		//ten-thousands
ora #$30		// -->ascii
sta screenposition+1	//print on next screen position

lda score2		//same procedure for all digits
...
```

### Snippet Codice (BASIC)

```basic
ldx #$05
		lda #$00
!:		sta carry,x		//clear carry table
		dex
		bpl !-

		ldx #$05		//6 digits
!:		lda figure1,x           //current score, usually located in screen memory
		clc
		adc figure2,x           //add points
		adc carry,x
		and #$0f		//check bits0-3
		cmp #$0a		//if >=10
		bcc nocarry
		inc carry-1,x		//then set carry for next digit...
		sec
		sbc #$0a		//... -10 for correct ascii
nocarry:	ora #$30		//-->ascii
		sta sum,x
		dex
		bpl !-
		rts

figure1:	.byte		$31, $32, $30, $33, $37, $39 		//   120379 (example)
figure2:	.byte		$32, $32, $30, $39, $32, $31 		//  +220921
carry:		.byte		$00, $00, $00, $00, $00, $00		//tmp for carry
sum:		.byte		$00, $00, $00, $00, $00, $00
```
