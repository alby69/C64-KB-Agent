    OP CODE: MVN (block MoVe Next)
    ==============================
    
    Addressing Modes:
        Block Move                       ($54 - 3 bytes, * cycles)
        * 7 Cycles per byte moved.
    Flags Affected:
        N/A
    Description:
        Moves (copies) a block of memory to a new location. The source,
        destination and length operands of this instruction are taken from the
        X, Y, and C (double accumulator) registers; these should be loaded with
        the correct values before executing the MVN instruction.
        The source address for MVN, taken from the X register, should be the
        starting address (lowest in memory) of the block to be moved. The
        destination address, in the Y register, should be the new starting
        address for the moved block. The length, loaded into the double
        accumulator (the value in C is always used, regardless of the setting
        of the m flag) should be the length of the block to be moved minus one;
        if C contains $0005, six bytes will be moved. The two operand bytes of
        the MVN instruction specify the banks holding the two blocks of memory:
        the first operand byte (of object code) specifies the destination bank;
        the second operand byte specifies the source bank.
        The execution sequence is: the first byte is moved from the address in
        X to the address in Y; then X and Y are incremented, C is decremented,
        and the next byte is moved; this process continues until the number of
        bytes specified by the value in C plus one is moved. In other words,
        until the value in C is $FFFF.
        If the source and destination blocks do not overlap, then the source
        block remains intact after it has been copied to the destination.
        If the source and destination blocks do overlap, then MVN should be
        used only if the destination is lower than the source to avoid
        overwriting source bytes before they’ve been copied to the destination.
        If the destination is higher, then the MVP instruction should be used
        instead.
        When execution is complete, the value in C is $FFFF, registers X and Y
        each point one byte past the end of the blocks to which they were
        pointing, and the data bank register holds the destination bank value
        (the first operand byte).
        Assembler syntax for the block move instruction calls for the operand
        field to be coded as two addresses, source first, then destination
        – the move intuitive ordering, but the opposite of the actual operand
        order in the object code. The assembler strips the bank bytes from the
        addresses (ignoring the rest) and reverses them to object code order.
        If a block move instruction is interrupted, it may be resumed
        automatically via execution of an RTI if all of the registers are
        restored or intact. The value pushed onto the stack when a block move
        is interrupted is the address of the block move instruction. The
        current byte-move is completed before the interrupt is serviced.
        If the index registers are in eight-bit mode (x = 1), or the processor
        is in 6502 emulation mode (e = 1), then the blocks being specified must
        necessarily be in page zero since the high bytes of the index registers
        will contain zeroes.

    Addressing Modes:
        Block Move                       ($54 - 3 bytes, * cycles)
        * 7 Cycles per byte moved.

    Description:
        Moves (copies) a block of memory to a new location. The source,
        destination and length operands of this instruction are taken from the
        X, Y, and C (double accumulator) registers; these should be loaded with
        the correct values before executing the MVN instruction.

        The source address for MVN, taken from the X register, should be the
        starting address (lowest in memory) of the block to be moved. The
        destination address, in the Y register, should be the new starting
        address for the moved block. The length, loaded into the double
        accumulator (the value in C is always used, regardless of the setting
        of the m flag) should be the length of the block to be moved minus one;
        if C contains $0005, six bytes will be moved. The two operand bytes of
        the MVN instruction specify the banks holding the two blocks of memory:
        the first operand byte (of object code) specifies the destination bank;
        the second operand byte specifies the source bank.

        The execution sequence is: the first byte is moved from the address in
        X to the address in Y; then X and Y are incremented, C is decremented,
        and the next byte is moved; this process continues until the number of
        bytes specified by the value in C plus one is moved. In other words,
        until the value in C is $FFFF.

        If the source and destination blocks do not overlap, then the source
        block remains intact after it has been copied to the destination.

        If the source and destination blocks do overlap, then MVN should be
        used only if the destination is lower than the source to avoid
        overwriting source bytes before they’ve been copied to the destination.
        If the destination is higher, then the MVP instruction should be used
        instead.

        When execution is complete, the value in C is $FFFF, registers X and Y
        each point one byte past the end of the blocks to which they were
        pointing, and the data bank register holds the destination bank value
        (the first operand byte).

        Assembler syntax for the block move instruction calls for the operand
        field to be coded as two addresses, source first, then destination
        – the move intuitive ordering, but the opposite of the actual operand

        is interrupted is the address of the block move instruction. The

        necessarily be in page zero since the high bytes of the index registers
        will contain zeroes.
