# How to code for the EasyFlash cart

# How to code for the EasyFlash cart

(a Quick-Start, see [EasySDK Guide](http://codebase64.net/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=base:easysdk.pdf) for detailed information)

EasyFlash consists of 2 Flash memory chips of 512 KB each.

It has a total of 1MB.

One Flash chip for low bank (at $8000),

one for high bank (at $a000 or $e000 in UMAX mode).

8 kb per chip can be banked into c64 memory at a time.

There is a total of 64 Banks.

The active bank is selected via $de00.

*$de00 always selects low and high bank simultaneously.*

$de02 selects the configuration:

- bit 7: toggle board LED
- bit 6: reserved
- bit 5: reserved
- bit 4: reserved
- bit 3: reserved
- bit 2: GAME MODE /1: controlled via bit0 /0: from jumper
- bit 1: EXROM state /0: high
- bit 0: GAME state (if bit 2 set) /0: high

In practice this means:

lda #%00000100 ;Cartridge ROM off (256 Bytes of RAM still available at $dfxx) lda #%00000101 ;Ultimax Mode (low bank at $8000, high bank at $e000) lda #%00000110 ; 8 Kb cart (low bank at $8000) lda #%00000111 ;16 Kb cart (low bank at $8000, high bank at $a000) sta $de02

Example:

To access 8Kb low and 8Kb high of Bank 0:

lda #$37 ;enable CART ROM sta $01 lda #$00 ;select bank sta $de00 lda #%00000111 ;select 16 Kb configuration, low at $8000, high at $a000 sta $de02 ldx #00 lda $8000,x ;access data from EasyFlash ($8000-$bfff in this case)

*$de00 and $de02 are WRITE ONLY, so you can not use INC or DEC to change banks or settings.*

Naturally the memory configuration via $01 remains valid,

i.e. #$37 or #$33 to enable CART ROM.

Note, that the additional RAM is always visible in I/O space at $dfxx.

*EasyFlash always starts up in Ultimax mode after Reset,*

hence you have to provide some startup code if you write your own crt.

The following snippet provides a commented working framework (ACME Assembler format) by skoe.
