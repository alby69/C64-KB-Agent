One has I'm really unclear about what you are saying. I for one don't think x=1 is a particularly good random number generator, and I'm not even sure what the last "it" of the last sentence refers to. Moreover, all random number generators use an iterative method. I will try another explanation. First, an anecdote from "Numerical Recipies". One of the authors had found that the IBM "RANDU" random number generator didn't work very well. He called customer support, and they said he had misused their generator: "We guarantee that each number is random individually, but we don't guarantee that more than one of them is random." There's an important moral here: "random" is really a relative quantity. That is, the important thing is the _sequence_ of numbers that a random generator produces. The sequence should be very long, and be totally uncorrelated. So now consider a generator like x=f(x), and for simplicity consider x to be an 8-bit number. Eventually the generator will hit a number it has already generated, at which point the sequence will repeat. Naturally one would like the sequence to be as long as possible -- 23 233 23 233 ... isn't a very useful sequence. Since x is an 8-bit number, the longest possible sequence has all 256 numbers. This is one reason to generate every number in the interval -- it makes sure the sequence has a long period. Moreover, the sequence should be uniformly distributed throughout the interval -- not only should no single number be more probable than any other, but no group of numbers should be more probable than any other. For example, numbers between 20 and 30 shouldn't be more probable than numbers between 241 and 251. Note that sometimes you do want a non-uniform distribution -- say, a Gaussian distribution of random numbers -- but these are invariably generated from a uniform distribution. Finally, the sequence should be uncorrelated. The sequence 0 1 2 3 ... is uniform and has a long period, but certainly isn't random. Here's another sequence: 142 3 84 242 198 30 34 204 239 77 ... It looks reasonably random. In fact, I generated it using a=a+2*pi/4.321 x=128*(1+cos(a)). So it takes some real work to ensure that a sequence really is random. Much of this falls under the broad rubric of "Time Series Analysis" -- you've got a sensor sending numbers to you, and want to know if the resulting time series is chaotic, nonlinear, deterministic, correlated, etc. This is also a subject I don't know much about. For random numbers, though, there are several tests available. Knuth has one in vol. 2 of "The Art of Computer Programming", and I'm sure that Numerical Recipies references some of the more recent schemes. It is worth emphasizing that what is important here is that the _sequence_ is random. Making sure that "each number is random individually" doesn't mean anything. This is why doing things like swapping bytes is such a bad idea -- it doesn't make the number "more random", but it does wreck the sequence. It's also why doing things like reading from SID four times to make a new floating point number never work well. In fact, even reading from SID is probably a bad idea, in terms of generating a sequence with the above properties (and at worst, you might sample at some period of the random number generator -- of course it's very improbable :), but it gives a flavor of the problems). Why is all of this important? For most computer science applications, it isn't. For most scientific applications, it is terribly important. Cute tricks like swapping bytes can be absolutely devastating to e.g. a Monte-Carlo integrator. Unless that sequence has the right properties, you just aren't simulating nature. A computer jock without any mathematical or scientific background is to be distrusted absolutely! (For scientific applications anyways.

I read about this method in the paper "Equation of State Calculations by 
Fast Computing Machines", by Nick Metropolis, Edward Teller, Marshall
Rosenbluth, Arianna Rosenbluth, and Augusta Teller (Journal Chem Phys.,
v21 No. 6, June 1953).  "Useless" is a very strong adjective; therefore
I strongly disagree with it.

I'm really unclear about what you are saying.  I for one don't think
x=1 is a particularly good random number generator, and I'm not even
sure what the last "it" of the last sentence refers to.  Moreover,
all random number generators use an iterative method.  I will try

Looks neat, but I bet it fails the spectral tests -- i.e. probably
fine for CS applications, but death for any Real application :).

BTW, looks like you're on a Sun -- those ps options have different

It would be interesting to see if these pass the tests.  I also wonder
what effect generators have on the underlying security.  I have zero
experience in this area -- it's a serious question!

S/KEY uses a phrase typed in from the keyboard, so my guess is
"not much".
