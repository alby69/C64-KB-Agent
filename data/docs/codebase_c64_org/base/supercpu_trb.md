    /*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
    OP CODE: TRB (Test and Reset memory Bits against accumulator)
    =============================================================
    
    Addressing Modes:
        Absolute                        ($1c - 3 bytes, 6 cycles¹)
        Direct Page                     ($14 - 2 bytes, 5 cycles¹²)
        ¹ - Add 2 cycles if m = 0 (16-bit memory/accumulator)
        ² - Add 1 cycle if low byte of Direct Page register is other than zero
            (DL< >0)
    Flags Affected:
        z - Set if memory value AND’ed with accumulator value is zero; else
            cleared.
    Description:
        Logically AND together the complement of the value in the accumulator
        with the data at the effective address specified by the operand. Store
        the result at the memory location.
        This has the effect of clearing each memory bit for which the
        corresponding accumulator bit is set, while leaving unchanged all
        memory bits in which the corresponding accumulator bits are zeroes.
        Unlike the BIT instruction, TRB is a read-modify-write instruction, not
        only calculating a result and modifying a flag, but also storing the
        result to memory as well.
        The z zero flag is set based on a second and different operation the
        ANDing of the accumulator value (not its complement) with the memory
        value (the same way the BIT instruction affects the zero flag). The
        result of this second operation is not saved; only the zero flag is
        affected by it.
        8-bit accumulator/memory (65C02;65802/65816, m=1): Values in
        accumulator and memory are eight-bit.
        16-bit accumulator/memory(65C02;65802/65816, m=1): Values in
        accumulator and memory are sixteen-bit: the low-order eight bits are
        located at the effective address; the high-order eight bits are at the
        effective address plus one.
    Notes:
