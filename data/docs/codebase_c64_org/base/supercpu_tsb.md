    /*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
    OP CODE: TSB (Test and Set memory Bits against accumulator)
    ===========================================================
    
    Addressing Modes:
        Absolute                        ($0c - 3 bytes, 6 cycles¹)
        Direct Page                     ($04 - 2 bytes, 5 cycles¹²)
    Flags Affected:
        z - Set if memory value AND’ed with accumulator value is zero; else
            cleared.
    Description:
        Logically OR together the value in the accumulator with the data at the
        effective address specified by the operand. Store the result at the
        memory location.
        This has the effect of setting each memory bit for which the
        corresponding accumulator bit is set, while leaving unchanged all
        memory bits in which the corresponding accumulator bits are zeroes.
        Unlike the BIT instruction, TSB is a read-modify-write instruction, not
        only calculating a result and modifying a flag, but storing the result
        to memory as well.
        The z zero flag is set based on a second different operation, the
        ANDing of the accumulator value with the memory value (the same way the
        BIT instruction affects the zero flag). The result of this second
        operation is not saved; only the zero flag is affected by it.
        8-bit accumulator/memory(65C02;65802/65816, m = 1): Values in
        accumulator and memory are eight-bit.
        16-bit accumulator/memory (65802/65816 only, m = 0): Values in
        accumulator and memory are sixteen-bit: the low-order eight bits are
        located at the effective address; the high-order eight bits are at the
        effective address plus one.
