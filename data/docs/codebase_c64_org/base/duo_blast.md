                ### Duo Blast

You will need to use sprite pad to draw 3 sprites. Actually, just draw two triangles. One that points up and another that points down. Finally draw a small square or a dot then save the lot. Now try this Acme Cross Assembler routine.

Creating your first game

```
;This is an example tutorial for you to 
;learn how to create your own 2 player 
;Shot 'em Up, which includes joystick 
;control, a score system, etc. 
;Let's setup the perameters for our 
;game. These are the player positions. 
plr1_x   = $0340 ;Player 1 x-position 
plr1_y   = $0341 ;Player 1 y-position 
plr2_x   = $0342 ;Player 2 x-position 
plr2_y   = $0343 ;Player 2 y-position 
;Our parameters for the player bullets 
plr1b_x  = $0344 ;Player 1 bullet-xpos 
plr1b_y  = $0345 ;Player 1 bullet-ypos 
plr2b_x  = $0346 ;Player 2 bullet-xpos 
plr2b_y  = $0347 ;Player 2 bullet-ypos 
;Collisions parameters 
plr1col  = $0350 ;Value storage for p1 
plr2col  = $0354 ;Value storage for p2 
;bullet lockup routines 
plr1lockup = $0360 ;Lockup for players 
plr2lockup = $0361 ;shooting 
  
;We need to create a jump start for this 
;example, so we will create our own jump 
;address where it does not overlap data 
;which had been loaded.

### Snippet Codice (BASIC)

```basic
;This is an example tutorial for you to 
;learn how to create your own 2 player 
;Shot 'em Up, which includes joystick 
;control, a score system, etc. 

;Let's setup the perameters for our 
;game. These are the player positions. 

plr1_x   = $0340 ;Player 1 x-position 
plr1_y   = $0341 ;Player 1 y-position 
plr2_x   = $0342 ;Player 2 x-position 
plr2_y   = $0343 ;Player 2 y-position 

;Our parameters for the player bullets 

plr1b_x  = $0344 ;Player 1 bullet-xpos 
plr1b_y  = $0345 ;Player 1 bullet-ypos 
plr2b_x  = $0346 ;Player 2 bullet-xpos 
plr2b_y  = $0347 ;Player 2 bullet-ypos 

;Collisions parameters 

plr1col  = $0350 ;Value storage for p1 
plr2col  = $0354 ;Value storage for p2 

;bullet lockup routines 

plr1lockup = $0360 ;Lockup for players 
plr2lockup = $0361 ;shooting 
  

;We need to create a jump start for this 
;example, so we will create our own jump 
;address where it does not overlap data 
;which had been loaded.
